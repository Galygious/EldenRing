3:T41a,Elden Ring Map: Caelid Starting Point. Exploring Caelid can be a challenging task for players. The western area is quite easy at this point, but the east area is tough and the north (Dragonbarrow) is best tackled later on. Many players may prefer to take the path North from Liurnia of the Lakes and through the Ruin-Strewn Precipice to explore the Altus Plateau first (especially if you want to access the Sealed Tunnel as early as possible for the Smithing-Stone Miner's Bell Bearing [2] to freely upgrade any normal weapons up to +12, which you would need to tackle both at Altus Plateau and Caelid). You can even go to Mt Gelmir before coming to Caelid. The reason this walkthrough opts to visit Caelid first is because there is little of consequence in Altus for the story, some NPC questlines start in Caelid, you find the Dectus Medallion (Right) in Caelid which leads Altus Plateau being a natural progression point after Caelid, and Mt. Gelmir is intended as higher level (upgrades there are +15-20 and +6-8 while Caelid is +10-14 and +4-5).5:["slug","caelid-south","d"]
