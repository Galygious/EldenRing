## Guide

**Elden Ring Map: Mountaintops of the Giants Starting Point.**  
If you’re also doing Volcano Manor/Tanith’s questline, remember to return there after its final part is complete.  
- This zone begins with a one-way path leading straight to the first map fragment: **Map Mountaintops of the Giants, West**.  
- Activate the site of grace and speak with Shabriri for an overview. (If you’ve already met Three Fingers, you will instead find the Ronin’s Set.)

Next, explore **Zamor Ruins** and locate stairs descending to a chest containing the Smithing-Stone Miner's Bell Bearing [3]—this lets you purchase Smithing Stones (5) & (6) at the Roundtable Hold.  
- You can also loot **Zamor Ice Storm** (Spell) here.

Follow the road east and north through a narrow passage until you reach a small landing with Fire Monk enemies.  
- On the right side of a bridge, complete **Giants' Mountaintop Catacombs** (defeat the boss to obtain Glovewort Picker's Bell Bearing [2], Fire Monk Ashes, and a Deathroot from a chest behind the fight).  
- You may also loot **Briars of Punishment** before proceeding past an Archer Golem—use double-jump to keep moving.
- Arrive at **Ancient Snow Valley Ruins**; explore the canyon floor north until you reach a frozen river guarded by Guardian Golems.  
- Then head east (take your first right) to loot a Golden Seed.  
- Backtrack slightly and then head west past demi-humans and bats until you find **Shack of the Lofty**.  
  - Here, you can loot the Traveling Maiden Set and, if doing Volcano Manor quests, challenge Juno Hoslow.

To the south of Shack of the Lofty, take the spirit spring to higher ground and complete **Stargazer's Ruins** by summoning the Jelly Fish Spirit Ashes—this rewards you with the Primal Glintstone Blade.  
- Also, talk to Brother Corhyn before crossing a narrow bridge southeast, looting a Somber Smithing Stone (9) on the way, then reach the region's **Minor Erdtree**.  
  - If you have the Tonic of Forgetfulness from Tanith, you can optionally give it to Corhyn here.  
- Defeat the Erdtree Avatar to loot Crimson Bubbletear and Cerulean Crystal Tear.  
- Then, take the northern bridge to cross to the **Snow Valley Ruins Overlook Site of Grace**.

From here, travel east through the graveyard until you reach the **Freezing Lake Site of Grace** (located just to the right before the frozen lake).  
- Look upward to the southwest of the site: to the left, a tower structure; to the right, a fragment of a broken bridge pointing toward the tower.  
- Climb back up the cliffs to the bridge where skeletal archers stand; behind them, an invisible path leads up to **Heretical Rise**.  
  - Use your torch or online messages to navigate and obtain the **Founding Rain of Stars** from within the tower (beware of ambushing enemies).  
- After finishing in this area, travel south down the eastern slopes to the frozen lake (which remains snowstorm-engulfed until you defeat Borealis the Freezing Fog).  
  - The lake’s southeast has a Site of Grace and the **First Church of Marika**—visit to collect a Sacred Tear and Somberstone Miner's Bell Bearing (3).  
  - Optionally, explore the mid-west section of the lake to enter **Spiritcaller Cave** (fighting Godskin Apostle & Godskin Noble for the Black Flame Ritual incantation; also contains the White Reed Set and Godskin Swaddling Cloth).

Once done with the lake, head south along the road from Heretical Rise to unlock **Whiteridge Road Site of Grace**.  
- You can optionally do the Lord Contender’s Evergaol nearby or continue to **Guardian’s Garrison** to loot the Giant’s Prayerbook.  
- Then, cross a frozen chain to the southeastern area where you’ll find the **Giant's Gravepost Site of Grace** and the **Map (Mountaintops of the Giants, East)**.  
- This area has challenging enemies with long reach—ride by if needed.

Next:  
- Follow the cliff edge west until you find a narrow jump across a gap landing you above **Zamor Ruins**.  
  - The **Giant-Conquering Hero's Grave** here contains high-level ash materials (Grave Glovewort 7, 8, and 9), as well as the Giant's Seal and Flame, Protect Me. (Bring 2 Stonesword Keys to unlock.)  
  - The boss here, the Ancient Hero of Zamor, drops the Zamor Set and Zamor Curved Sword.

Teleport back to **Giant's Gravepost** and take the south road toward the **Church of Repose**.  
- Expect an invasion by Okina before arriving; be prepared with hemorrhage resistance to defeat him and receive the Okina Mask and Rivers of Blood katana.  
- The church also contains a Sacred Tear, and looking to the southeast from the church, you will find a massive cliff-skull containing an Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone (in its mouth) and, on top (reachable via a spirit spring), the Ash of War: Troll's Roar.

From the church, follow the eastern cliffs north and unlock the **Foot of the Forge Site of Grace**.  
- Across the chain is the Fire Giant boss fight—but before engaging, travel north to loot a Golden Seed and nearby Crimsonwhorl Bubbletear (which converts damage received into HP; see its guide for details).

Now take a detour to **Castle Sol**:  
- Return to the **Snow Valley Ruins Overlook** and wait until nightfall.  
- Far west (north of Shack of the Lofty as seen on the map), a Death Rite Bird will invade (drops the Death Ritual Spear).  
- Then, travel north and east toward the **Walking Mausoleum** area.  
  - Unlock the site of grace, defeat a Tibia Mariner for a Deathroot, then enter the Castle.  
  - If you spoke to Latenna earlier, she will alert you when you’re near Castle Sol.

See the Castle Sol page for a detailed walkthrough.  
- You will need to challenge Commander Niall to obtain the Haligtree Secret Medallion (Left).

After completing Castle Sol, you have a choice:

1. Return to Foot of the Forge and defeat the Fire Giant, then backtrack to a secret location in Consecrated Snowfield.  
2. Ignore Foot of the Forge and the Fire Giant, then backtrack to Consecrated Snowfield.  
3. Return to Foot of the Forge and defeat the Fire Giant, then proceed to Fire Forge and be automatically teleported to Crumbling Farum Azula.

For this walkthrough, option 1 or 2 is recommended to keep the story flow better.
