## Guide

**Elden Ring Map: Forbidden Lands Starting Point.**  
The Forbidden Lands connect Leyndell, Royal Capital with the Mountaintops of the Giants.  
- There is not much to do here aside from two boss encounters.  
  - The first boss appears only at night: a Night's Cavalry that drops Ash of War: Phantom Slash.  
  - Further north, a Golden Seed can be looted.
- Before accessing the lift, you will face **Black Blade Kindred**, who drops Gargoyle's Black Axe and Black Blades.
- Talk to the Palm Reader near the lift for lore, then activate the lift to ascend to the Mountaintops of the Giants.
