## Guide

**Elden Ring Map: Leyndell, Ashen Capital Starting Point.**  
After defeating Maliketh at Crumbling Farum Azula, a cutscene plays and you are teleported back to Leyndell, now in a different state.  
- Interact with the **Leyndell, Capital of Ash Site of Grace** nearby.  
- When you return to the Roundtable Hold, you will notice drastic changes; speak to Roderika and Hewg for new dialogue.

Next:  
- Return to Jarburg and speak with Jar Bairn to hand over Alexander's Innards; exhaust his dialogue and reload the area.  
- At Jar Bairn’s spot, you will find the Companion Jar; near Diallos’ spot, find Hoslow's Petal Whip and Diallos's Mask.

From the **Leyndell, Capital of Ash Site of Grace**:  
- If you haven’t yet explored the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds in Leyndell, Royal Capital, there is a sewer hole in the ruined road southwest to access it.  
  - It is recommended to clear it now before further progressing in Ashen Capital. (Even if already cleared, drop down to pick up the Crimson Amber Medallion +2 along the way.)  
- Once done, teleport back to the Site of Grace and head south to find a corpse with a Rune Arc.  
  - In this area, you may also find corpses with a Tarnished Golden Sunflower and a Golden Sunflower.  
  - Make your way southwest from the Rune Arc to locate a set of stairs.

To the west, there is a ruined part of Leyndell’s walls with an illusory tree marking a Golden Seed (likely already looted if fully explored).  
- From this tree, head down the stairs directly north and, once outside, head northwest to find a Valiant Gargoyle.  
  - Behind the wall in front of the gargoyle, you may find a Somber Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone.

If following the Brother Corhyn questline, return to the curved staircase and look to the right between the stairs and the ruined wall for an ash-covered slope.  
- Cross the large tree branch to find a Smithing Stone (6) and follow the cliff face east until you encounter Goldmask, from whom you receive the Mending Rune of Perfect Order.  
  - Reload the area to obtain his armor set (Goldmask’s Set, minus the mask).  
- Corhyn can also be found at the Ashen Capital; in the southwestern section, locate a giant dead dragon with a large spiral spear near its base—Corhyn sits there.  
  - Exhaust his dialogue and reload to acquire Corhyn's Robe and Corhyn's Bell Bearing.  
  - (If you offered him the Tonic of Forgetfulness earlier at the Stargazers' Ruins, he will be found there instead.)

Backtrack to the staircase and, at the top, take the lift to a higher level where you will meet **Sir Gideon Ofnir, the All-Knowing**.  
- Defeat him to receive the All-Knowing Set and the Scepter of the All-Knowing.

Interact with the **Erdtree Sanctuary Site of Grace** (which spawns after Gideon’s defeat) and head east out to the main balcony.  
- Turn left and scale the tree root to the west. Follow the path north until you reach the **Queen's Bedchambers**.  
  - Here, you will find the Erdtree Heal incantation (centered on the “bed”).

Continue out the door east and up the stairs until you encounter a fog door.  
- Beyond this door is **Godfrey, First Elden Lord** in physical form (not his golden spectral version from earlier).  
  - After reducing his health to about 33%, he transforms into **Hoarah Loux, Warrior**; defeating him grants the Remembrance of Hoarah Loux.
- Interact with the **Elden Throne Site of Grace** that spawns afterward, then head up the stairs to the southeast.  
  - Touching the golden light at the top teleports you to the final two bosses: first **Radagon of the Golden Order**, then the **Elden Beast**.  
  - Defeat both to receive the Elden Remembrance and then interact with Fractured Marika to trigger the ending sequence.
