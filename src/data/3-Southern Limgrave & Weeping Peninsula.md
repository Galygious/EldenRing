## **Meet Yura & Take on Dragon**

Elden Ring Map: Southern Limgrave Starting Point. You are now ready to explore Southern Limgrave. Travel northeast to the underpass (directly west of the Artist's Shack, down at the ravine underneath a ruin) and talk to **Bloody Finger Hunter Yura**, then proceed to **Lake Agheel** to challenge and defeat the dragon in this area, **Flying Dragon Agheel**. You can summon players or use Spirit Ashes to help with the fight. Using Torrent is suggested. The **Dragon Heart** you obtain can be traded for Incantations at the **Church of Dragon Communion** accessed by traversing through **Coastal Cave**.

## **Obtain Sorcery Scroll**

If you are a sorcerer, you will want to obtain the **Royal House Scroll**, that you can bring to **Sorceress Sellen** to unlock more inventory at her shop. Head southeast from the **Agheel Lake South** site of grace, toward the top of a cliff and you'll see a statue of an object that looks like the half piece of a bowl or a circle. Face the other way, to see a **Knight**. Keep going to a structure to see a man standing watching over the big structure, alongside a dead body. In that body, you will find the **Royal House Scroll**.

---

## **Continue Blaidd's Quest – Forlorn Hound Evergaol**

To continue **Blaidd's quest**, head to the **Forlorn Hound Evergaol** and summon **Blaidd** for the fight against **Bloodhound Knight Darriwil**. Back outside he'll reward you with a **Somber Smithing Stone (2)** for helping him.

---

## **Talk to Irina**

Proceed south into the Weeping Peninsula and you'll meet **Irina** by the road. She will ask you to talk to her father at **Castle Morne**. You will get there later so for now just continue down the road and rest at the **Castle Morne Rampart** site of grace. A miniboss roams the area at night. This is a **Night's Cavalry** and defeating him will give you the **Ash of War: Barricade**.

---

## **Obtain a Memory Slot**

Take the jump spring near the **Site of Grace** to gain access to a tower. **Oridys's Rise** is a mage tower and contains an item that increases your memory slots, the **Memory Stone**. There are multiple of these to be found throughout the game, and they are usually in towers such as this one. You have to find and hit 3 turtles to unlock the entrance. See the [Oridys's Rise page](URL - You'll need to provide the actual URL here) for details on where they are. After that, head north of the tower to find a site of grace, and a few enemies. Further after that, you'll find a corpse on a chair holding a **Stonesword Key**, and a statue which points to the nearby catacombs to complete.

## **Additional Points of Interest in Weeping Peninsula**

### **Forest Lookout Tower (Hand Ballista)**

Southwest from the **Bridge of Sacrifice** grace, there is a **Forest Lookout Tower** which rewards a **Hand Ballista**.

---

### **Demi-Human Forest Ruins (For Mages)**

Directly south of here is a grace named **South of the Lookout Tower**. If you play as a mage, your next stop is **Demi-Human Forest Ruins** (following the path west from this grace), as their leader drops the **Demi-Human Queen's Staff** which is quite good at low levels (you could also fast travel to the **Sellia Crystal Tunnel** grace you found earlier in Caelid, and find the **Meteorite Staff** in the **Swamp of Aeonia** on a corpse in the **Street of Sages Ruins**).

---

## **Get Sacred Tears & Flask Materials from Minor Erdtree**

From here you will head North to find a **Faith-knot Crystal Tear** guarded by some hostile plants. Directly west is a church containing a **Sacred Tear** for your flask. South from here leads to both the **Tombsward Catacombs** and the **Minor Erdtree**, which contains both the **Crimsonburst Crystal Tear** and **Opaline Bubbletear** for your flask. Down the plains, you can see a Mausoleum: these are used to replicate Remembrances, which are the "Boss Souls" of the main bosses of the game.

---

## **West of the Minor Erdtree – Additional Points of Interest**

Several points of interest are also west of the **Minor Erdtree**, including another church holding another **Sacred Tear**, and the **Isolated Merchant's Shack**, which you can buy a **Lantern** to avoid needing a torch for dark areas. Note that in the **Witchbane Ruins** north of the shack, the **Sorceress Sellen** is there, but there is no way to interact with her for now. Keep the location in mind, though, because it will become important in the later stages of her quest.

---

## **Complete Castle Morne**

It's now time to take on **Castle Morne** south of where **Night's Cavalry** was. Note a golden seed right hand side on the path towards castle (which also leads to a map fragment of Weeping Peninsula). This is a simple souls-style dungeon, with a lot of verticality. Notable points are to not miss the drop to meet Irina's Father. From Take the lift to the castle proper and from the entrance go straight past a **Pumpkin Head** and to the right. Take the ladder, defeat nearby enemies and cross a bridge. With the bridge to your back look LEFT for some barrels. Break them to reveal a ladder and drop down below. Follow this path past some enemies and up a tower to meet Edgar.

---

## **Finish Irina’s Questline**

Once you complete the boss of the area, return to Irina's father, and finally back to **Irina** to finish their quest. You can also go straight back to Irina without speaking to her father, in which case you skip out on some dialogue. (Note that I would advise against completing this quest too soon until your weapon upgrade is at least +8, because you'll obtain a+8 weapon after progressing enough in this questline, which may affect your ability to interact with other players since matchmaking is affected by weapon level).
