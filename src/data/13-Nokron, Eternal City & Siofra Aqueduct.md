## Guide

**Elden Ring Map: Nokron Starting Point.**  
With Starscourge Radahn defeated, a new underground region is now accessible. If you go back to Iji, he has some dialogue about Blaidd. Head back to Mistwood and southeast of the Mistwood Ruins, where Blaidd leaves a message near the edge of the newly formed crater. (These next few steps are completely optional.)  
- Head back to Forlorn Hound Evergaol to find Blaidd.  
- After choosing to let him out (or keep him in), return to Iji for further dialogue.

When you’re done, teleport back to Mistwood and make your way south until you find a huge crater west of Fort Haight. Descend down the crater using the platforms on its eastern side until you arrive at Nokron, Eternal City. On the way, keep an eye out for corpses carrying a Golden Rune [5] and two Soporific Grease.

At this point, you’re on the outskirts of Nokron. Note that Nokron shares a map fragment with Siofra River, so the map may seem confusing. From here, getting to the heart of the city is straightforward:  
- Carefully navigate the jumps downward on Torrent and head through a tunnel that initiates a no-horse zone.

Past the tunnel, you’ll find a plank way and then a pillar top that you can jump onto. To the right, an item is visible on the roof—but the jump is a bit too far. You might even see a white spirit attempt the jump. An alternative is to wield the Winged Scythe (found in Tombsward Ruins) and use its special attack to cross the gap (repeat for a second gap) to reach the rooftop and pick up the Ghostflame Torch.

Next:  
- Jump down and retrieve the Rune Arc off a corpse on the roof.  
- Head north, scaling up the building, and enter a window on the side that opens into a cavern.  
- Before dropping down where Fallen Hawks Soldiers lurk, loot the corpses on the ledge for a Furlcalling Finger Remedy and a Smithing Stone [5].  
- After clearing enemies and collecting Ghost Glovewort [3], head through the doorway to the north to interact with the **Nokron, Eternal City Site of Grace** and enter the heart of the city.

Inside the city:  
- On the steps of a gazebo lies a corpse with the Ghost-Glovewort Picker's Bell Bearing [1].  
- Corpses are scattered throughout, offering various levels of Smithing Stones, Somber Smithing Stones, and additional Ghost Gloveworts.  
- Head east (next to the descending stairs) to a small graveyard to collect the Greatshield Soldier Ashes and two Ghost Glovewort [3].  
- In the building opposite the graveyard, find a corpse guarded by two Fallen Hawks Soldiers that holds a Larval Tear.

Once finished collecting in this area:  
- Descend the stairs eastward and turn right at the corner to spot a fog door in the distance.  
- Loot corpses along the way for another Larval Tear, a Ghost Glovewort [3], and a Golden Rune [7].  
- At the bottom of the crumbling steps, turn around to pick up a Rune Arc on a dead body.  
- When ready to face the boss, traverse through the mist.

Inside the large temple ruin:  
- Approach the center of the arena. The slime puddle will reveal itself to be the Mimic Tear—transforming into your character.  
- Defeat it to receive the Silver Tear Mask, two Larval Tears, and unlock further progress into Nokron, Eternal City.

Upon exiting the arena:  
- Cross the bridge; as soon as it’s safe, turn left and get off the bridge.  
- Walk westward until you reach the **Ancestral Woods Site of Grace**.  
- Facing southwest, jump down to the roof of a building. (Do not worry about items in the northeast yet.)  
- Jump down to the next building’s ledge, turn right, and then jump down to the corpse hanging over the banister. You’ve reached **Night's Sacred Ground** (the safe path may not be obvious).  
- Follow the building’s edge and note another Rune Arc on a corpse at the top of large stairs to your right.  
- Turn back and jump down to the next building where two Silver Tears hang.  
- After defeating them, head east along the building’s edge and walk across the wall ruin to reach the open windows on the other side.

Now in the main temple of Night’s Sacred Ground:  
- On the corpse slumped in front of the altar, you will find the Black Whetblade.  
- Head through the eastern hallway to find an imp statue beside a door that must be unlocked with a Stonesword Key. Inside, you’ll encounter a Swordstress, a chest containing the Mimic Tear Ashes, and a Smithing Stone [3].  
- Retrace your steps back through the hallway to the bottom floor of the temple. There, the large silver ball is a disguised Silver Tear that drops a Larval Tear when defeated (additional disguised Silver Tears can be found in Nokstella, Eternal City).  
- Exit the temple and descend the stairs to locate a Site of Grace on your left.

After resting, continue northeast up the road, defeating enemies and looting corpses (including Celestial Dew). Note that the Silver Tear at the base of the stairs transforms into a Troll.  
- At the top of the stairs beneath a massive skeleton sits a chest containing the Hidden Treasure of Nokron, the Fingerslayer Blade, and a Great Ghost Glovewort.  
- The waygate next to the giant statue will return you to the Ancestral Woods Site of Grace.

Feel free to explore the hilly parts of Nokron and its ruins to collect valuable items such as:  
- Clarifying Horn Charm +1  
- Mottled Necklace (+1)  
- Celestial Dew  
- Ash of War: Enchanted Shot

While exploring, you may notice another **Hallowhorn Grounds** with unlit obelisks. The altars to activate are located at:  

- **First Pillar:** By the cliff's edge, next to the broken bridge used to get here. [Map Link]  
- **Second Pillar:** Alongside the brick road. [Map Link]  
- **Third Pillar:** Up on a ledge next to the brick road with an Ancestral Follower singing. [Map Link]  
- **Fourth Pillar:** By a large rock. [Map Link]  
- **Fifth Pillar:** By the cliff's edge, next to submerged ruins guarded by Giant Rats and chanting Ancestral Followers. [Map Link]  
- **Sixth Pillar:** Behind a deer carcass in a ruin beside the Hallowhorn Grounds. [Map Link]

At the Fifth Pillar, consider taking a detour to the submerged ruins. There, you’ll find Ghost Glovewort (5) and the Ancestral Infant's Head in a chest.  
- Once all six altars are lit, return to Hallowhorn Grounds to challenge the Regal Ancestor Spirit and obtain the Remembrance of the Regal Ancestor.

Next:  
- Head to the cliff behind Hallowhorn Grounds where many spirit jellyfish dwell.  
- Look down to find a small ledge—on your right, there’s a corpse with a Stonesword Key; on your left, a cavern with the **Aqueduct-Facing Cliffs Site of Grace**.  
- Follow the path further down the cave to a support structure you can jump to.

This long structure is the **Siofra Aqueduct**. Its outer walls have branching platforms containing valuable items such as the Order Healing spell, a Rune Arc, and Missionary's Cookbook (5). An NPC here will offer the Inner Order Gesture in exchange for the Twinned Armor Set.

- Navigate to the lowest level of the aqueduct and exit into a cavern at the base of a large waterfall.  
- As you approach, a Valiant Gargoyle will jump from the ceiling; when reduced to about half health, the Valiant Gargoyle (Twinblade) will join the fight.  
- Defeat both to receive the Gargoyle's Greatsword and Gargoyle's Twinblade.  
- The **Great Waterfall Basin Site of Grace** becomes accessible after this boss fight.  
- Resting in the coffin north of this site will transport you to the secret area of Deeproot Depths, useful for advancing Fia's quest.  
- But first, visit Ranni to obtain the Cursemark of Death.
