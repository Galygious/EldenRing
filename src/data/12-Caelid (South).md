## **Complete Smoldering Church**

Elden Ring Map: Caelid Starting Point. Exploring Caelid can be a challenging task for players. The western area is quite easy at this point, but the east area is tough and the north (Dragonbarrow) is best tackled later on. Many players may prefer to take the path North from Liurnia of the Lakes and through the Ruin-Strewn Precipice to explore the Altus Plateau first (especially if you want to access the Sealed Tunnel as early as possible for the Smithing-Stone Miner's Bell Bearing [2] to freely upgrade any normal weapons up to +12, which you would need to tackle both at Altus Plateau and Caelid). You can even go to Mt Gelmir before coming to Caelid. The reason this walkthrough opts to visit Caelid first is because there is little of consequence in Altus for the story, some NPC questlines start in Caelid, you find the Dectus Medallion (Right) in Caelid which leads Altus Plateau being a natural progression point after Caelid, and Mt. Gelmir is intended as higher level (upgrades there are +15-20 and +6-8 while Caelid is +10-14 and +4-5).

If you decide to tackle Caelid, then continue reading from here. If you want to do Altus, then scroll down to it using this handy click. We will include a way to return to this point from the end of Altus as well.

To get into Caelid, you can start from the **Summonwater Village Outskirts** site of grace and head Northeast past the **Summonwater Village** and follow the path until you get to the **Rotview Balcony** site of grace. There are some items in the buildings around the site of grace with some surprise attacks waiting when you grab them. Kill the monsters, loot the items, and head northwest to the **Smoldering Church**.

Your first objective as you enter is to complete **Smoldering Church**. There's an NPC invasion here by **Anastasia, Tarnished-Eater** who drops a talisman, but the church also has 2 cookbooks that you want: **Nomadic Warrior's Cookbook (14)** and **Missionary's Cookbook (3)**. From here you will want to activate the site of grace at the **Shack of the Rotting** to make sure you have an easy respawn if things go badly.

## **Obtain Flask & Spirit Upgrades**
Follow the road forward from the **Smoldering Church** and you will come to the **Minor Erdtree** of the area. Defeat the **Putrid Avatar** and get **Flame-Shrouding Cracked Tear** and **Greenburst Crystal Tear**. You can then opt to explore the nearby **Minor Erdtree Catacombs**, you can loot **Grave Glovewort (5)** and the **Mad Pumpkin Head Spirit Ashes** from a duo boss within.

---
## **Get Golden Scarab talisman**
After this continue following the road and you can loot the **Greatsword** from the travelling wagon. Ahead there are some ruins with a duo of **Pumpkin Head** mini-bosses that let you loot the **Visage Shield**.

---
## **Find Iron Fist Alexander**
Grab the **Smoldering Wall** site of grace near the telescope icon on the map. Travel east from the telescope icon and head towards the canyon. Look for exposed tree roots to jump onto and cross the canyon to the **Abandoned Cave**. Make sure to use gear with Immunity to fight against the pools of Scarlet Rot, and have some Preserving Boluses at hand! The Cleanrot Knight boss duo within can be challenging, but they drop the **Gold Scarab** talisman that can make rune farming a lot faster. There's also the **Serpent Bow** and **Venomous Fang** claw weapon to loot here.

---
## **Clear Fort Gael**
Return to the **Smoldering Wall** site of grace just south of the telescope icon. To the west of this location, back toward Limgrave but on the lower level, you can find **Gael Tunnel** and challenge the **Magma Wyrm** to get 1 **Dragon Heart** and **Moonveil** (the Katana all PvPers love!). Explore thoroughly and find rear **Gael Tunnel** entrance to trigger your second encounter with **Alexander**. (If for whatever reason you don't find him here, you'll find him later at the festival.)

---
## **Obtain Map Fragments**
There are several upgrade materials to be looted in and out of the tunnel so make sure to check the Elden Ring Map. You can also kill an invisible **Teardrop Scarab** near the tunnel's exit to loot **Ash of War: Flame of the Redmanes**. NOTE: The invisible **Teardrop Scarab** that offers Flame of Redmanes can be found just northeast of the **Fort Gael North** site of grace. Listen for a tinkling bell sound, and then a trail of sparkles on the ground running around in circles. Get in the path of the circle and time your attack correctly to hit it and get its **Ash of War**.

Further south from here you will be able to explore **Fort Gael**. There's **Starscourge Heirloom**, a **Katar** and **Ash of War: Lion's Claw** inside the fort building. At the top of the fort building, there is a gateway leading to a location east of the **Impassable Greatbridge** site of grace in South Eastern Caelid near Redmane Castle. Don't take it right now if you want to continue exploring naturally, but you can progress this way if you want to. Behind the building, there are two flame thrower vehicles and between them there's a body on which you can find the **Flame, Grant Me Strength** incantation.

---
## **Unlock Zone Merchants**
Find **Gaol Cave** to the northeast in the canyon and unlock it with **Stonesword Keys**. Within you will find some upgrade materials, a shield, and a **Frenzied Duelist** boss that drops **Putrid Corpse Ashes**. The rear entrance of the cave allows you to drop down to an item that's technically in Limgrave: **Regalia of Echoid (Straight Sword)**.

Make your way southeast, and loot the **Meteoric Ore Blade** in **Caelid Waypoint Ruins**. Go back to the road and follow it south to the **Caelid Highway South** site of grace. Just south of the site of grace is a dragon with Scarlet Rot breath named **Decaying Ekzykes**. Killing him is optional, but provides another **Dragon Heart** and makes a Scarlet Rot breath incantation, **Ekzykes's Decay**, available at the **Churches of Dragon Communion**. Further along the road, find the area's **Map**. Near the map site, you will find a merchant here that sells **Stonesword Key** and **Nomadic Warrior's Cookbook (15)**. The **Southern Aonia Swampbank** site of grace is just Northeast of the merchant.

---
## **Defeat Dragon, Deathbird & Night's Cavalry**
Visiting this location at night will let you challenge the **Night's Cavalry** of the area and obtain his drop: **Ash of War: Poison Moth Flight**. Slightly east from here, a **Death Rite Bird** also spawns at night, and drops the **Death's Poker** greatsword.

Explore the road South from the fork by the merchant and loot a **Golden Seed**, then go westward to find the **Cathedral of Dragon Communion**, that allows you to buy special Dragon Incantations based on the dragons that you have defeated. Loot the **Ancient Dragon Apostle's Cookbook (3)** before leaving. Explore nearby to find the **Caelid Catacombs**, which is directly east near the road following the cliffs nearby, then following a right U-turn heading west, past which you'll encounter a **Teardrop Scarab** holding a **Somber Smithing Stone [4]**. Inside the **Caelid Catacombs** there's an illusory wall that hides **Miranda Ashes**, and the **Kindred of Rot** ashes can also be obtained within, alongside upgrade materials.

---
## **Loot Sellia Crystal Tunnels**
You can now opt to follow the road south and east to visit and complete **Redmane Castle**, or go north toward the swamp and explore **Sellia**.

To complete exploration, start the swamp from the **Astray from Caelid Highway North** site of grace that is just south of the **Telescope icon** on your map. There's a teardrop scarab that drops **Ash of War: Lifesteal Fist**, and a merchant with some uninteresting consumables. Go into the swamp and slightly north to find several useful items, including the **Meteorite Staff** and the spell **Rock Sling**, in the **Street of Sages Ruins**. The very north of the swamp has **Sellia Crystal Tunnel** - you may have been teleported here earlier by the trap chest in **Dragon-Burnt Ruins**. Get your revenge on the enemies within and defeat the **Fallingstar Beast** to get **Somberstone Miner's Bell Bearing (1)** and unlock Somberstone purchases at the **Roundtable Hold**.

---
## **Meet Gowry and Millicent**
To the east of the Swamp is **Sellia, Town of Sorcery**. This is an important location with many items to pick up. Notably, you will meet **Gowry** at his shack just north of Sellia Gateway, who will task you with defeating **Commander O'Neil** in the swamp to obtain the **Unalloyed Gold Needle**. Commander O'Neil can be found in a large clearing within **Aeonia Swamp** in eastern Caelid. Players can easily reach his arena by traveling southwest from Sellia, Town of Sorcery (a further up north), looking for a large group of trees in a circular formation and jumping over the mutated growths with Torrent.

After you defeat **Commander O'Neil**, return the **Unalloyed Gold Needle** to **Gowry** so he can repair it. Reload the area and talk to him again to get the repaired **Unalloyed Gold Needle**. Next we should visit Church of the Plague to meet Millicent., however we must first make a little progress inside Sellia, Town of Sorcery before we can reach the church.

---
## **Complete Sellia, Town of Sorcery**
Read the [Sellia, Town of Sorcery page](URL - You'll need to provide the actual URL here) for a proper walkthrough of the area. There is useful loot in there but of particular note is a **Golden Seed** and **Imbued Sword Key**.

After finishing **Sellia, Town of Sorcery**, you can take the path north, up the stairs and up the mountain, to the **Church of the Plague** and talk to **Millicent** and hand over the **Unalloyed Gold Needle** to her. Be sure to loot the **Sacred Tear** in the church. Reload the area and speak to her to obtain the **Prosthesis-Wearer Heirloom**.

Return to **Gowry's Shack** to find Millicent again. Don't forget to exhaust her dialogue to move her to Altus Plateau for later.

---
## **Complete Redmane Castle**
It is now time to take on **Redmane Castle**. See the [Redmane Castle page](URL - You'll need to provide the actual URL here) for information on how to navigate and loot it, and challenge **Starscourge Radahn** to progress the game. Be sure to speak to **Iron Fist Alexander** and **Blaidd** before fighting **Radahn**. (Note: After defeating the duo bosses at Redmane Castle, if the Old Geezer has a dialogue loop where he mentions that he "no use for you yet", assuming you've accepted Ranni's quest earlier in the walkthrough, go speak to Iji at the Road To The Manor grace, nearby Caria Manor. He should talk about the Festival. Exhaust his dialogue, and fast travel back to Redmane Castle Plaza grace, where all the NPCs now should have gathered at the Plaza. Now you can challenge **Starscourge Radahn**. Good luck!)

---
## **Defeat Starscourge Radahn**
After you defeat him, you can talk to **Iron Fist Alexander** and **Blaidd** near the site of grace. You can now explore the **War-Dead Catacombs** to the north of the arena (you may want to leave them for later as they are quite challenging maybe level 80+).

---
## **Complete War-Dead Catacombs**
Note: If you want to save Nokron Eternal City, Liurnia of the Lakes (West), Nokstella Eternal City / Lake of Rot, and the Deeproot Depths for later and instead tackle Atlus Plateau, you may do so since it will be level-appropriate for your character, and there's no consequence for it. Otherwise, continue reading from here.

## **Head to Altus Plateau (optional)**
