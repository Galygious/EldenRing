## **Buy Essential Gear**

Elden Ring Map: Limgrave Region starting point. Limgrave has a lot of places to visit, but only a few of them are essential. Right next to the **First Step Site of Grace** you'll find **White Mask Varre**. Exhaust his dialogue for some info about the world and to start his quest. Your first step will be to head to **Church of Elleh** and meet **Merchant Kale**, one of the **Nomadic Merchants** of the game. Patrolling between the starting point and the church is a **Tree Sentinel** boss. He will be extremely difficult at this stage of the game, so it is strongly suggested to avoid him until you unlock your horse and become stronger. Defeating him rewards you with his **Golden Halberd**. At the church, buy the **Crafting Kit** Kale offers, a **Torch**, and the **Telescope**. Also make note of the nearby upgrade bench. You can do optional cave and catacomb objectives to gain talismans and materials as needed.

## **Obtain Limgrave West Map Fragment & Whetstone Knife**

Head over to **Gatefront Ruins** and obtain the **Limgrave West map fragment** for the area. Also pick up the **Whetstone Knife** so you can use **Skills** in your weapon and get **Ash of War: Storm Stomp** from an underground chest.

---

## **Unlocking Torrent & Spirit Calling Bell**

Visit 3 sites of grace, or rest in the **Gatefront Site of Grace** to speak with **Melina** and unlock **Torrent**, your mount. After this, teleport to the **Church of Elleh Site of Grace** to meet **Renna** and unlock the **Spirit Calling Bell** and get the **Lone Wolf Ashes**.

---

## **Boc the Seamster's Quest**

South-east from **Gatefront Ruins** (past east of the telescope on the map), you'll hear a shout belonging to **Boc the Seamster**. He's been transformed into a small red tree, so hit the small tree once and talk to him to begin his questline (see [Side Quests](URL - You'll need to provide the actual URL here) for other quests). This quest will take you to the **Coastal Cave** (southern portion of the western beach), which also unlocks access to the **Church of Dragon Communion** (if you continue further in the cave without exiting it via portal). Defeat the demi-humans in the **Coastal Cave**, then go back to Boc at the entrance to return his **Sewing Needle and Tailoring Tools**. South-east from Boc's first location, a **Night's Cavalry** will spawn during night right on the bridge. Defeating him awards the **Ash of War: Repeating Thrust**.

## **Find Sorceress Sellen (if you're a mage)**

If you are a mage or intend to learn sorceries, you will want to unlock **Sorceress Sellen** in **Waypoint Ruins** - follow the road south from **Gatefront Ruins** to find it. She's past the **Mad Pumpkin Head** Boss fight.

---

## **Talk to Roderika**

Head towards **Stormhill** (past the **Gatefront grace** leading west) and talk to **Roderika** to begin her quest and receive the **Sitting Sideways** gesture, alongside the **Spirit Jellyfish Ashes**. If you want to further Roderika's quest in its entirety, make sure to retrieve the **Chrysalids' Memento** in **Stormveil Castle** later. You will pick up a **Golden Seed** just before arriving at **Stormhill Shack**. There's also a **Stonesword Key** here that you will want to start collecting.

---

## **Find Ashes of War Merchant**

Follow the road East from the **Stormhill Shack** in **Stormhill** and you'll come to **Warmaster's Shack**, where you can purchase **Ashes of War** from **Knight Bernahl**. At night, Bernahl will be gone, and a **Bell Bearing Hunter** boss will spawn as you enter the shack. Note that this boss may be extremely challenging at this point in the game. Defeating him awards the **Bone Peddler's Bell Bearing**. Similar to ashes hunter badges in previous games, Bell Bearings unlock new items in the game's primary shop when given to the **Twin Maiden Husks** after you arrive at **Roundtable Hold**. Just south from here in the hills where the trolls are, you can visit at night and be invaded by a **Deathbird** mini-boss and get the **Blue-Feathered Branchsword** talisman.

---

## **Meet Potboy (Alexander)**

Continue northeast along the road from **Warmaster's Shack** and turn right as you see a bridge and hear someone shouting. There is a small path to take up the cliff to your right-hand side. You will meet **Alexander (Potboy)** and can free him to begin his quest and earn the **Triumphant Delight** gesture and 1x **Exalted Flesh**. You have to hit him with a heavy attack or several times from behind.

---

## **Deathtouched Catacombs & Assassin Gear**

Before we proceed, there's another dungeon nearby with useful loot, especially if you're going for an assassin type class. Return a bit west, to the barricades you passed through where you just fought the dog and commoners. Leave the barricades and head east along the road towards the bridge again. This time stick to the left of the road. Before the bridge, follow the path next to the cliff and you will find **Deathtouched Catacombs**. Inside there will be gathering/farm materials, upgrade materials, an **Uchigatana**, the talisman **Assassin's Crimson Dagger** and a **Deathroot**.

---

## **Hunter of the Dead Questline**

Further down the road, past the bridge, you can meet **D, Hunter of the Dead**, and begin his quest (if you already reached the **Roundtable Hold** before this point, he will not show up since you would have first met him at the hold instead of near past the bridge, but quest progression remains the same).

---

## **Murkwater Cave & Bloody Finger Hunter Yura**

You will now want to return to the lower area of Limgrave, to go up the ravine from Agheel Lake until you find **Murkwater Cave** that has a special surprise, and then **Murkwater Catacombs**. You will get invaded here, so be careful! If you wait a bit to defeat the invader, **Bloody Finger Hunter Yura** will show up to help you defeat him. You can meet him back north of **Murkwater Cave** afterwards, where you can exhaust his dialogue to start his quest.
