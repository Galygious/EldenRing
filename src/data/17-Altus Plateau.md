## Guide

**Elden Ring Map: Altus Plateau Starting Point.**  
The Altus Plateau, located northeast of Liurnia, is your next destination. There are two access routes:  
1. Fight your way up the cliffside dungeon at **Ruin-Strewn Precipice** (the red-outlined hole on the map, accessible from the northern canyon of Liurnia of the Lakes).  
2. Use the left and right halves of the Dectus Medallion at the **Grand Lift of Dectus**.  
   - If you lack the right half of the medallion, fast travel to the Dragonbarrow West Site of Grace, head east until you find Fort Faroth, and obtain it from a chest after defeating or skipping enemies.

Once you’ve found your first Site of Grace in Altus:  
- Return to the **Roundtable Hold** and speak with Brother Corhyn (his quest begins here).

> **Note:** Taking the Grand Lift using the Dectus Medallions will cause you to meet Rya the Scout, who will offer to take you to Volcano Manor. It’s recommended to delay that until later. Instead, activate the grace directly north of her to obtain the two map fragments for Altus before continuing.

**Ruin-Strewn Precipice** is best accessed via **Ravine-Veiled Village**. If you do not yet have access:  
- Fast travel to Caria Manor (Royal Moongazing Grounds Site of Grace), exit to the west, make a U-turn right (grabbing the Behind Caria Manor Site of Grace on the way), then head southeast from there to a visible rock outcropping that lets you cross the ravine (north of Bellum Church).  
- Turn north (left after the rock jump) and follow the slope downward. You’ll see a Golden Seed mid-slope.  
- Shortly after, you’ll arrive at the Ravine-Veiled Village Site of Grace, then proceed to Ruin-Strewn Precipice.

At Ruin-Strewn Precipice:  
- Fight another version of the Magma Wyrm. Afterwards, head up to the plateau to find the Ruler's Set.

Now at the **Abandoned Coffin Site of Grace** (visible on your map):  
- Head west and defeat a Teardrop Scarab to loot Ash of War: Sacred Order.

Further west:  
- **Perfumer's Ruins** yields the Omenkiller Set, Perfumer's Cookbook (1), and Perfumer's Talisman.  
- Nearby, **Unsightly Catacombs** contains valuable Ghost Glovewort (5) and Grave Glovewort (4) along with the Perfumer Tricia spirit ash (from the dual boss).  
- In the northern lake area, **Sage's Cave** (with many illusion walls) contains plentiful loot; one illusion hides an optional boss battle with Necromancer Garris (drops Family Heads flail). At the cave’s end, you can also fight the Black Knife Assassin (drops Concealing Veil). (See the Sage's Cave guide for full details.)

Return to the Abandoned Coffin and follow the road north toward **Lux Ruins**.  
- An optional fight with Ancient Dragon Lansseax may occur here; if you prefer, run past it to meet Millicent at the **Erdtree-Gazing Hill Site of Grace**. There’s a Golden Seed ahead.  
- Veer slightly south to Erdtree-Gazing Hill and Lux Ruins.  
  - Ash of War: Shield Crash can be looted from a Teardrop Scarab, and the Greatshield Talisman from a chest further east.

> **Note:** If Millicent is not found, return to Gowry’s Shack in Caelid; she should reappear there. Fast travel back to the Erdtree-Gazing Hill Site of Grace, look north, exhaust her dialogue, and move on.

From Erdtree-Gazing Hill:  
- Go straight north and up to reach **Wyndham Ruins** and **Wyndham Catacombs**. Here, defeat Tibia Mariner to earn a Deathroot and Tibia’s Summons spell.  
  - The catacombs boss drops Glovewort Picker’s Bell Bearing [1], enabling low-level grave glovewort purchases at the Roundtable Hold.

Next:  
- From Erdtree-Gazing Hill, head east to an encampment guarded by commoners, ballistas, and a Pumpkin Head.  
  - A chest here contains the colossal sword *Troll’s Golden Sword*.  
- Then, turn north into the canyon. Keep the cliff on your left until you encounter a troll.  
  - Shortly ahead lies **Old Altus Tunnel** (requires two Stonesword Keys).  
    - Inside, loot Smithing Stones (4) & (5) and Somber Smithing Stones (5) & (6).  
    - The Stonedigger Troll boss drops the Great Club and Troll’s Hammer.  
    - Boldrake Talisman +1 is also available from nearby sheds.

Continue north along the canyon until you reach a poisonous area: this is **Shaded Castle**.  
- (See the Shaded Castle guide for a full walkthrough.)  
- Notable items: Perfumer's Cookbook (2) and the Valkyrie’s Prosthesis (required for Millicent’s quest).  
- West of the castle, an invasion by Maleigh Marais (Shaded Castle Castellan) yields the House Marais Set and Antspur Rapier.

Teleport back to Erdtree-Gazing Hill and talk to Millicent again (exhaust her dialogue). You may also return to Gowry’s Shack for new dialogue and incantations.  
- Then, travel south from Millicent’s position and east to the road by the **Grand Lift of Dectus**.  
- Down the slopes east of here lies the **Golden Lineage Evergaol**, where the optional boss **Godefroy the Grafted** drops the useful Godfrey Icon talisman (for charged spells/skills).

Now, follow the main road north and activate the **Altus Highway Junction Site of Grace**.  
- Nearby, meet Boc the Seamster (map link) and speak with him (if he isn’t here, you must progress his questline).  
- A Night’s Cavalry will appear on this road at night; defeat him for Ash of War: Sacred Order.

North from the site of grace, the road leads to a Golden Seed and Altus Plateau map fragment.  
- Slightly north, speak with Brother Corhyn (who is looking for the Goldmask).  
- Directly east from Altus Highway Junction Site of Grace, follow the road until it breaks off into an open cave. Inside the cave, the **Amber Starlight** rests below a statue surrounded by octopus-ball creatures.  
  - After exiting the cave, continue east to find the **Perfumer's Grotto Cave** (blocked by a large hostile plant).  
    - The boss inside drops the Great Omenkiller Cleaver.

> **Map Link:** You need Amber’s Starlight for Seluvis’s quest. When convenient, return to Seluvis to hand over the Amber Starlight for the Magic Scorpion Charm, then speak with him again to receive the Amber Draught. Next, deliver the concoction to Ranni, then return to Seluvis for his loot.

Finally, from the road where you found the area map, head northwest and down the slopes to visit the **Second Church of Marika** and loot the Sacred Tear there.  
- At this location, Bloody Finger Hunter Yura appears, triggering an invasion from Eleonora (Violet Bloody Finger), who yields Purifying Crystal Tear alongside Eleonora's Poleblade (a very useful item for an upcoming boss).

Return to the road and follow it north to locate the **Finger Reader Crone** and the **Forest-Spanning Greatbridge Site of Grace** (map link). Also, find a teleporter that takes you further north and a nomadic merchant offering the Ancient Dragon Apostle's Cookbook [2].  
- Use Torrent to jump across broken gaps on the bridge leading into the valley, then head southwest to the **Bower of Bounty Site of Grace**.  
- From there, head northeast to the **Minor Erdtree**.  
  - The tree is protected by Wormface, a boss that drops Speckled Hardtear and Crimsonspill Crystal Tear; there is also a Golden Seed slightly north (map link).  
- In the area northeast of the Minor Erdtree, locate the Greatshield Icon Shield near the Woodfolk Ruins (guarded by slugs and a Wormface enemy).

Within the valley:  
- You will find **Mirage Rise** to the far west. Follow the steps (see accompanying image) to unlock the tower and gain the Unseen Form and Unseen Blade spells:  
  1. The first symbol is immediately in front of the Imp Statue.  
  2. The second is located south-southwest in an alcove.  
  3. The third is further east near a broken bridge, hidden beneath an illusory rock with a faint glow that disappears when attacked.

Directly south of the Woodfolk Ruins, **Altus Tunnel** contains Smithing Stone (5) upgrades and Somberstone Miner's Bell Bearing (2).  
- Before or after entering the tunnel, search nearby ruins for an underground cellar guarded by Wormface enemies; here, loot Wrath of Gold from a chest.  
- Also, at the Woodfolk Ruins, find the Nomadic Warrior's Cookbook (19) and a teardrop scarab that drops Ash of War: Golden Slam.

Next, follow the road north out of Erdtree Valley. After passing a village attack, near a windmill, turn east toward the city gates.  
- Soon, a Golden Seed (map link) will be to your right.  
- From here, enemies will shoot deadly ballistas and catapults. Instead of heading east to the capital, go north into **Dominula, Windmill Village**.  
  - Here, defeat the Godskin Apostle boss (drops the Scouring Black Flame incantation for Millicent’s quest) and unlock the site of grace.  
  - Millicent can be found nearby (see Map Link). Exhaust her dialogue to continue her quest, and note the Godskin Peeler twinblade and Celebrant's Skull warhammer in this area.

If you return to the road, you have the option to head east into **Lyndell, Capital City** outskirts. (This will be covered later.) Instead, take the lower road southeast to reach unnamed ruins where a noble transforms into a Lion Guardian.  
- Defeat it to get a Larval Tear, then continue until you reach an elevation with lightning and (optionally) the second part of the Ancient Dragon Lansseax encounter (if you fought her earlier at Mt. Gelmir).  
  > **NOTE:** Lansseax is glitchy; if she does not appear as expected, simply reload by resting at a nearby grace site.

From here, west of the ruins is another boss encounter with a **Black Knife Assassin** just outside the Sainted Hero's Grave.  
- This boss drops the unexpectedly faith-scaling Black Knife.  
- The grave contains the Crimson Seed Talisman and Dragoncrest Shield Talisman +1, as well as the Ancient Dragon Knight Kristoff spirit ashes.  
- South of this area, **Stormcaller Church** has a Sacred Tear to loot, along with the Dragonbolt Blessing incantation.

You have now successfully looted the eastern part of Altus Plains.  
- Backtrack to Dominula, Windmill Village and head west.  
- Follow the main road west then south to find the collapsed bridge.  
  - There, you can find Goldmask; speak with him (he has no dialogue, but is key to Brother Corhyn's questline).  
  - Nearby, in the third section of the collapsed bridge, is the Radiant Gold Mask helm. To find it, face south at the start of the collapsed bridge, jump down to your left, and then follow the terrain and the second section’s connection (use the map for reference).  
  - Use Torrent for the double jump, then fast travel to Brother Corhyn near the Altus Highway Junction Site of Grace and inform him of your findings. He will then move to Goldmask’s location.

Return to Goldmask and note that Corhyn will have additional incantations and dialogue to progress his quest.  
- Further north, in the higher areas, the **Windmill Pastures (East and West)** hold the Noble's Set, Battlemage Set, and Giant Rat Ashes.  
- You may do a quick sweep here before returning to the road to pick up the Great Stars Warhammer from an enemy caravan.  
- Following this road west will lead directly to Mt. Gelmir.
