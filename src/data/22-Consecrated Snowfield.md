## Guide

**Elden Ring Map: Consecrated Snowfield Starting Point.**  
Access to this area is granted only after obtaining both halves of the Secret Haligtree Medallion (use them at the Grand Lift of Rold by selecting “switch”).  
- This teleports you to the Hidden Path to the Haligtree area. (Completion here is not mandatory, but it’s advisable to obtain essential loot such as Grave Glovewort (9), Deathroot, Blackflame Monk Amon Ashes, and Silver Scarab/Spelldrake Talisman +2.)

Once out, you will find yourself in a snowstorm with very poor visibility.  
- Latenna will instruct you on how to reach **Apostate Derelict**.  
- First, head due north to unlock the initial Site of Grace, then follow the barely visible road to collect Nomadic Warrior's Cookbook (23) and a Golden Seed.  
- If you opt to stick to the right (east) and go north out of the hidden path catacombs, you will find a teardrop scarab dropping Somber Smithing Stone (8) near the cookbook.
- Continue along the cliff into the storm until you reach the **Consecrated Snowfield Catacombs**.

The Catacombs are highly recommended:  
- They reward you with a Great Grave Glovewort for defeating the boss, as well as additional Grave Glovewort (8) and (9), several consumables, a Rotten Gravekeeper Cloak, and an Imp Head (Elder).

Exit the catacombs and go west into the storm.  
- You will encounter a traveling enemy caravan that drops St. Trina's Torch.  
- Continue west (slightly southwest from the Inner Consecrated Snowfield Site of Grace); another caravan here drops the Flowing Curved Sword (if visited at night, a double boss of Night's Cavalry drops the Night's Cavalry Set and an Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone).

Then, grab the Stalwart Horn Charm +1 before continuing west into **Yelough Anix Ruins** to collect the Unendurable Frenzy incantation.  
- Nearby, complete **Yelough Anix Tunnel** (yielding Somber Smithing Stone (8) and (9), an Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone, and the Meteorite of Astel gravity sorcerer via the boss Astel, Stars of Darkness).

Exit the tunnel and head north along the cliff edge past hooded trolls until you reach an area with Rune Bears and an invasion by Sanguine Noble (drops the Sanguine Set).  
- A short distance northwest from here (from a large tree with reddish foliage) is a gateway with blood—the teleporter point to **Mohgwyn Palace** (note its location for later).

Return to the **Inner Consecrated Snowfield Site of Grace**.  
- To the east on the cliffs overlooking the frozen river, loot Glintstone Craftsman's Cookbook (8) and the Albinauric Rise tower (requires summoning Fanged Imp Ashes to unlock the Graven-Mass Talisman).  
- Further east, you will be attacked by wolves; you may optionally take a gateway to access the Minor Erdtree—defeat the Putrid Avatar to loot Ruptured Crystal Tear, then follow the slope down and west.

Next, **Ordina, Liturgical Town** comes into view.  
- You may activate its Site of Grace (optional at this point); then, head slightly south to collect the town’s Golden Seed before riding to the frozen lake to pick up the Ordina map fragment.  
- Alternatively, loop around Ordina to loot the Black Knife Set from an arch on its northern outskirts.  
- West of Ordina, you can challenge a duelist for Rotten Greataxe and Rotten Duelist Greaves.  
- Your objective is to follow the river north to bypass the Walking Mausoleum’s attacks.  
  - At the river’s end, a Death Rite Bird spawns at night (drops Explosive Ghostflame).  
  - Then, find a narrow path along the cliffs (north and west) to ascend; use the cliff edge as cover against mausoleum attacks.  
- Ride into **Apostate Derelict** and loot the Silver Mirrorshield inside.  
  - You will be prompted to summon Latenna here; speak with her and exhaust her dialogue (this completes her quest).  
- Leave Apostate Derelict and deal with the mausoleum outside.

Now, you should complete **Mohgwyn Palace** via the gateway found earlier (Ordina, Liturgical Town unlocks the path to this challenging dungeon).

Alternatively, enter Ordina, Liturgical Town and activate the evergaol system to enter an instanced event.  
- In this event, light 4 candles at the following locations:
  1. **Candle #1:** In the central square (beware the shadow assassin).  
  2. **Candle #2:** At the far west edge of town; a ladder up blends in with the stones (turn right, jump over the balcony, then left around the town to reach it).  
  3. **Candle #3:** From the starting point, jump over the southern balcony, then at the stairs jump onto the upper railing and onto the left balcony; a ladder is directly to your left.  
  4. **Candle #4:** Likely the hardest—if you have Loretta's Greatbow (or another bow), first climb the stairs leading to the seal. Take a shot at the archer on the right; if necessary, finish him off from a different angle using the same ladder as Candle #3. Then follow the rooftops, climb the tower, and light the final candle.

Once all candles are activated, the northern wall magic block at the top of the northern staircase disappears, granting access to **Miquella's Haligtree**.
