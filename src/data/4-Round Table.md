## **Head up from Stormhill into Stormveil**

Go into **Stormveil** and defeat **Margit the Fell Omen** at its gates to ensure you unlock a conversation with **Melina** that takes you to the **Roundtable Hold**. Once here, you should talk to all **NPCs** and familiarize yourself with the many locked doors.

## **NPC Quests in Roundtable Hold**

### **Roderika & Hewg**

You'll find **Roderika** here once you've given her the **Chrysalids' Memento** (found in **Stormveil**) at **Stormhill Shack**, or have rested at any grace in **Liurnia**. She'll reward you with a **Golden Seed** if you have given her the memento - if not, you'll find a **Golden Seed** back a **Stormhill Shack** where she used to sit. Once Roderika is in the hold (this will be after Stormveil if you are following this route exactly), go back and forth speaking to **Roderika** and **Smithing Master Hewg**, choosing options that try to convince **Hewg** into taking **Roderika** as his apprentice. After you've exhausted all their dialogue, reload the **Roundtable Hold** and **Roderika** will now become your **Spirit Tuner** and the two will have additional dialogue. Return to the place you found the **Chrysalids' Memento** and you'll find the **Crimson Hood** in it's place. (Note: If you hadn't found the **Chrysalids' Memento** prior, it will be completely replaced by the **Crimson Hood**. The Memento is only used to progress Roderika's quest if you hadn't aquired the **Liurnia of the Lakes Site of Grace** early.)

### **D, Hunter of the Dead**

After defeating the **Tibia Mariner** in **Summonwater Village**, **D** can be found and spoken to at the **Roundtable Hold** if you haven't already in **Limgrave**. He'll show you the way to find another **NPC, Gurranq, the Beast Clergyman**. Once you visit **Gurranq**, **D** will sell his wares to you.

---

#### **Gurranq, the Beast Clergyman**

**Gurranq** can be found at the **Bestial Sanctum** in **Caelid**. If you teleport there as soon as you're given the waygate location by **D**, you may be a bit too underleveled to defeat the enemies there. Head straight into the building and don't fight the gargoyle here until you're strong enough to. His quest involves giving him **Deathroot**, and each time you give him one, you unlock a new item in his shop. After giving him the fourth **Deathroot**, an event triggers the next time you visit **Gurranq**. Damage your attacker until they've been pacified, but don't defeat them. **Gurranq's quest** ends after you've given him nine **Deathroot**.

---

### **Fia**

You can start **Fia's quest** by speaking to her in her room in the **Roundtable Hold**. She'll only speak to you in secret if you let her hold you. Doing so will give you **Baldachin's Blessing**, which decreases your maximum **HP** while it's in your inventory.

---

### **Brother Corhyn**

**Corhyn's quest** won't be started until a little later, but you can speak to him now for introductions and to purchase some incantations.

---

### **Diallos**

You can start **Diallos' quest** by speaking to him here. Simply exhaust his dialogue then he'll show up in another location later on.

---

## **Upgrade Your Weapons**

The most important thing to do here right now is to ensure that you **Upgrade your weapons** as much as possible as **Stormveil Castle** is a difficult endeavor and you will need all the help you can get.
