## Guide

**Elden Ring Map: Deeproot Depths Starting Point.**  
This special area is accessible only by teleporting from the coffin in Siofra Aqueduct, so it’s easy to miss. It is important for advancing Fia's quest and aligning with a specific faction for the endings. The area offers Smithing Stones (levels 4–6) and Ghost Gloveworts (levels 4–6); ensure your weapon upgrades are over +15 or +6, respectively.

- You spawn in a watery area beneath Lyndell, at **Great Waterfall Crest**.  
- Nearby, defeat an Erdtree Avatar and loot the Staff of the Avatar and Ash of War: Golden Land.  
- Cross the ravine to the west by carefully following roots. One root (heading northwest) leads into a cave populated by ants and ends with the Elden Stars incantation.  
- After crossing, head past the square with flying ants to meet the Palm Reader near the Deeproot Depths Site of Grace for lore details.

Next:  
- Navigate the roots north toward the flooded ruins until you find a gazebo with a corpse holding the Map (Deeproot Depths).  
- A nearby building contains Ash of War: Vacuum Slice.  
- Then, ignore most enemies and travel northwest to the **"Nameless Eternal City" Site of Grace**.  
  - A nearby coffin teleports you to Ainsel River main; however, your objective is to reach the roaming Walking Mausoleum and deactivate it (this despawns all Mausoleum Knight and Soldier enemies).

To deactivate the Mausoleum:  
- Go to the lower area north from the site of grace and continue west.  
- Loot the Stonesword Key in the area, then take the spirit spring upward.  
- You will land near Crucible Knight Siluria—defeat it and loot the Crucible Tree Set and Siluria's Tree.  
- Head east toward the branches; quickly navigate across them until you can jump **ONTO** the mausoleum.  
- (Dismount from Torrent before approaching, as basilisks and archers will interrupt.)  
- Once atop, hit the white skulls until they stop glowing, which despawns the Mausoleum enemies.

Now, you are free to roam and loot the remaining objects in the area. Then, return to the **Nameless Eternal City Site of Grace** and head east along the main branches.  
- Expect to fight fire-breathing Broken Statue enemies while crossing, then arrive at the **"Across the Roots" Site of Grace**.  
- Nearby, an entrance gives access to the **Fia's Champions** boss fight (an optional multi-wave fight).  
  - Defeating all five invaders will grant you Fia’s Mist sorcery.

Approach Fia (sitting to the left of the triggering waygate) and speak with her to continue her quest.  
- If you visited the Divine Tower of Liurnia previously, you will have the option to hand over the Cursemark of Death.  
- After giving it and exhausting her dialogue, reload the area and speak with her again.  
- Upon the next reload, she will be asleep at Godwyn’s side—inspect her to enter Godwyn's dream and fight Lichdragon Fortissax.  
- Defeating Lichdragon Fortissax grants you the Remembrance of the Lichdragon.  
- When you return from the dream, receive the Mending Rune of the Death-Prince from Fia (unlocking an alternate ending), then reload the area to loot her armor set (Fia’s Set).

> **Optional:** If you gave D’s Twin Brother the Twinned Set in Nokron, he will later appear by Fia. Exhaust his dialogue, then reload to retrieve the Twinned Set and receive the Inseparable Sword.
