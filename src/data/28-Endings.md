## Guide

There are five NPC questlines that lead to different endings: Ranni, Fia, Brother Corhyn, Dung Eater, and (though they have no individual questline) the Three Fingers. With the exception of the Three Fingers ending, when you interact with Fractured Marika after defeating the Elden Beast, you can choose which Mending Rune to use—thereby selecting your ending.

- **Three Fingers' Ending:**  
  - Interact with the Three Fingers in the depths of the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds to access the "Lord of Frenzied Flame" ending.  
  - You will be given the option to “Become the Lord of Frenzied Flame.” Note: Receiving the Flame of Frenzy locks you out of the other endings.

- **Removing the Flame of Frenzy:**  
  - To remove it, obtain the Unalloyed Gold Needle by defeating Commander O'Neil and bring it to Gowry for repair.  
  - Defeat Malenia, Blade of Miquella at Miquella's Haligtree and reload the area—there will be a Scarlet Aeonia in her boss room.  
  - Interact with it to receive Miquella's Needle.  
  - Then, head to Crumbling Farum Azula, approach the Dragonlord Placidusax boss fight, and immediately use Miquella's Needle (from your inventory) before fighting the dragon.

- **Ranni the Witch's Ending:**  
  - Complete Ranni’s questline and use the Dark Moon Ring on her body in the Cathedral of Manus Celes.  
  - After defeating the Elden Beast, instead of interacting with Fractured Marika, interact with Ranni's summon sign in front of it.

- **Fia's Ending:**  
  - Complete Fia’s questline.  
  - After giving her the Cursemark of Death and defeating Lichdragon Fortissax, you will obtain the Mending Rune of the Death-Prince from her body.  
  - Then, interact with Fractured Marika and choose to use this Mending Rune to get the "Age of the Duskborn" ending.  
  - (It is also possible to complete D’s Twin Brother’s questline by giving him the Twinned Set after receiving the Mending Rune.)

- **Brother Corhyn/Goldmask's Ending:**  
  - Complete their questline (which also involves finishing Crumbling Farum Azula).  
  - In Leyndell, Ashen Capital, you will find Goldmask and can loot the Mending Rune of Perfect Order from his body.  
  - After interacting with Fractured Marika, choose the option to use this Mending Rune for the "Age of Order" ending.

- **Dung Eater's Ending:**  
  - Complete the Dung Eater questline by giving him five Seedbed Curses (if you use Seluvis’s Potion instead, you will be locked out of this ending).  
  - After the screen goes black and you respawn, loot the Mending Rune of the Fell Curse from his body.  
  - Interact with Fractured Marika and choose to use this Mending Rune for the "Blessing of Despair" ending.

- **Default Ending:**  
  - If you finish the game without completing any of the NPC questlines or choose not to follow any, the default ending is the "Age of Fracture."  
  - After interacting with Fractured Marika, simply choose “Mend the Elden Ring.”
