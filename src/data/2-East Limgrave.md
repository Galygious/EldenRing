## **Talk to Kenneth Haight**

Elden Ring Map: East Limgrave Starting Point. East Limgrave doesn't have a lot of objectives, but the **Rune Bears** in the area are more than a challenge, so you should avoid them at all costs. Your plan for this area should be to loot and leave, as it's likely that you are underleveled for it.

First you will head to some broken structures along the northern cliff of the area (easiest place to start would be at the **Artist's Shack** grace or follow the road North from the **Gatefront Ruins** after passing the bridge). A group of demi-humans must be dispatched, then you can talk to **Kenneth Haight** atop the ruins, and agree to serve him. He asks you to liberate his keep to the south.

## **Get the Flask of Wondrous Physick**

Continue following the road northeast from here until you reach the **Third Church of Marika**, where you can loot the **Flask of Wondrous Physick** and the **Crimson Crystal Tear**. This is an important flask for your journey so don't miss it!

---

## **Get Limgrave, East Map Fragment & Flask Materials from Minor Erdtree**

Follow the road south until you find the area's map fragment. Beware of **Rune Bears**, but just by the map fragment you'll also find an altar with the **Greenspill Crystal Tear** and **Spiked Cracked Tear**. There's also a **Teardrop Scarab** nearby that drops **Ash of War: Ground Slam**.

---

## **Activate Siofra River Well**

Once you have looted the above, go inside the structure. Take the lift down all the way to the **Siofra River**, activate the **Site of Grace** down there, and head back up - you will come here later as it's very above your current level.

---

## **Trigger Blaidd event**

Nearby is the **Mistwood Ruins**, there is a howling wolf that you will hear. Once you hear him you can go back to the **Church of Elleh** location and talk to **Merchant Kal√©** who will give you a gesture. Do the gesture (**Finger Snap**) to the wolf and he will jump down, and you can talk to **Blaidd** and start his quest.

---

## **Liberate Fort Haight**

Continue south from here, you can take a detour to meet the **Nomadic Merchant** of the area if you wish. To the very south, you will encounter **Fort Haight**. There's a **Golden Seed** to be picked up before you go in. Then kill all the enemies within and loot the tower on the right side from the entrance to obtain the very important key item: **Dectus Medallion (Left)**. There's also **Nomadic Warrior's Cookbook (6)** and **Ash of War: Bloody Slash**.

---

## **Get Reward from Kenneth Haight**

Now that the fort is free, report back to **Kenneth** in the northern area. He will reward you with **Erdsteel Dagger** and offer you the opportunity to enter into his service, choice is up to you. You'll next find him back at **Fort Haight**, where you fought the knight that dropped the **Ash of War**.

---

## **Complete Summonwater**

Once this is done, head to **Summonwater** (northwest from the **Third Church of Marika**), where you will face a **Tibia Mariner** boss. Defeat it to gain your second **Deathroot** and the **Skeletal Militiamen Ashes**, which will enable a discussion with **D, Hunter of the Dead** at the **Roundtable Hold** (you may also find him instead near the **Summonwater Village Outskirts** grace west of here if you didn't reach the Hold yet). In a chest in an underground area, you will find the **Green Turtle Talisman**.

---

## **Teleport to Bestial Sanctum**

Afterwards, go back to the **Third Church of Marika**. In the back there will be a portal that will take you to your next location. Open the door and rest at the site of grace. **Melina** will offer to take you to the **Roundtable Hold** (which again, if you have not already reached yet earlier from resting at enough graces, since activating them alone isn't enough).

*   If you have access to the **Roundtable Hold**, after that discussion a gateway will be marked on your map that allows you to teleport to the **Bestial Sanctum** in eastern **Caelid**. You don't need to do this now so don't worry about it if you haven't been to **Roundtable Hold**!
