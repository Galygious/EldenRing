## Guide

**Elden Ring Map: Mt. Gelmir Starting Point.**  
Fast travel to the **Wyndham Catacombs Site of Grace**, then head west and descend to the canyon floor to reach **Seethewater River Site of Grace**.  
- Begin riding northward; a nearby teardrop scarab drops Ash of War: Barrage.  
- Continue north, avoiding waves of heat, until you reach a Golden Seed.  
- Further ahead, loot a Smithing Stone (5) before arriving at an Imp Gate (defended by Basilisks, requiring a Stonesword Key) in **Seethewater Cave**. Here, you can also obtain the peculiar Mushroom Set and the Kindred of Rot's Exultation talisman.

Follow the road north until a fort appears: **Fort Laiedd**.  
- Note: The map fragment is below the fort.  
- Activate the **Seethewater Terminus Site of Grace** and head inside Fort Laiedd to collect Armorer's Cookbook (7) and the Fire Scorpion Charm.  
- You may also loot a Stonesword Key near a jellyfish east of the fort (if needed for the cave).

South of Fort Laiedd, the road converges into a magma pool with a Magma Wyrm boss.  
- Defeat it to earn a Dragon Heart and unlock the Magma Breath spell at the Cathedral of Dragon Communion.  
- You will also meet Iron Fist Alexander for the fifth time; exhaust his dialogue to receive the Jar.  
  > **Note:** Be cautious—talking to Alexander in the wrong spot will cost you health.

Follow the road south past enemies and a rune-looted graveyard until you reach **Hermit's Shack**.  
- Defeat the demi-humans to loot Roiling Magma.  
- Optionally, use the giant Rune Bear to destroy a statue for additional Smithing Stones.

Continue along the road to arrive at **Craftsman's Shack**.  
- Here, you may obtain the Pulley Crossbow and activate a convenient Site of Grace.

Up ahead is **Hermit Village** (barricaded with several enemies).  
- Loot the Hierodas Glinstone Crown from a corpse in the southern part and the Prattling Pate "You're Beautiful" from a nearby door.  
- In the northern area of the village, defeat the miniboss **Demi-Human Queen Maggie** for a Memory Stone.  
- Slightly further north, defeat **Primeval Sorcerer Azur** to obtain Comet Azur and activate the site of grace.

Traverse the beam by the sorcerer to cross the canyon and drop down.  
- Activate the lift to **Gelmir Hero's Grave**. This location contains a Deathroot, the Bloodhound Knight Set, Gelmir Knight Set, Bloodhound Knight Floh spirit ashes, and the Mantis Blade (curved sword).  
- Once complete, return to the entrance and explore north.  
  - Expect a wolf pack ambush before arriving at a fortification defended by a Mad Pumpkin Head and soldiers.  
  - Loot the Pulley Bow here and, if you dismount near the Rainbow Stones on the ground, Patches may knock you to the ground near Seethewater Cave (preventing early access to Volcano Manor).

The road south from the Patches encounter leads to the **First Mt. Gelmir Campsite Site of Grace**, with a staircase descending to a dead-end road toward **Corpse-Stench Shack**.

Instead, cross the beam to the other side of the canyon and begin climbing a ladder behind a Grafted Scion mini-encounter.  
- This section is a series of ladders and optional loot drops (one rest features a Nomadic Merchant).  
- After climbing, cross a bridge to reach the **Ninth Mt. Gelmir Campsite Site of Grace**.  
- Jump via the Spiritspring or use the ladder to engage the Full-Grown Fallingstar Beast (which drops the Fallingstar Beast Jaw).

West of the boss’s crater, protruding rock formations serve as a bridge to another landmass—here you will eventually find a map piece and the **Road of Iniquity Site of Grace**.  
- Beware: Marionette Soldiers attack when you cross.  
- Loot a Golden Seed and kill an invisible Teardrop Scarab to obtain Ash of War: Through and Through.  
- As you approach the pillar containing the map piece, deadly Fingercreeper enemies will ambush—proceed to the site of grace first, then backtrack to loot the Mt. Gelmir map.

Now you have revealed the zone and are ready to proceed into **Volcano Manor**.  
- Start by heading west from the site of grace along an uphill path that ends in an encounter with Marionette Soldiers and a Frenzied Troll.  
- Optionally, you can also go east from the Road of Iniquity site to reach the **Minor Erdtree (Mt. Gelmir)**, where you can battle an Ulcerated Tree Spirit for Leaden Hardtear and Cerulean Hidden Tear.

> **Note:** For detailed Volcano Manor guidance, see its dedicated page. Also, ensure that all Volcano Manor NPC questlines (including Tanith’s) are completed before defeating Rykard, Lord of Blasphemy, to avoid locking out rewards in NG+.

There are additional NPC quests in Volcano Manor:  
- **Tanith** gives three requests—speak to Rya, Bernahl, and Diallos after each request.  
  - After the first request, Patches appears at the manor entrance and gives you the *Letter to Patches* (completing his quest nets the Bull-Goat Set and Magma Whip Candlestick).  
  - Rya moves to a new room after the first request; speak to her, then find the Prison Town Church Site of Grace, open its doors, and return to her to progress her quest.  
  - Speak with Tanith about Rya for an optional item later.
- After the second request, speak to Bernahl for the *Letter to Bernahl*. Help him and receive the Raging Wolf Set and Gelmir's Fury sorcery. Continue Rya’s quest by retrieving the Serpent’s Amnion (after defeating the Godskin Noble) and then speaking to Tanith to receive the Tonic of Forgetfulness. Choose your path with Rya (assist her for Daedicar’s Woe, or give her the tonic to have her fall asleep—resulting in Daedicar’s Woe after Rykard’s defeat).  
- After the third request, exhaust Diallos' dialogue; upon reloading, he will have left.

Following these events, Patches appears in **Shaded Castle** on the bridge leading up to Elemer's boss room—exhaust his dialogue to receive the Dancer’s Castanets, which you can then hand over to Tanith (now found in Rykard’s boss room).

Then, return to **Jarburg** and speak with Jar Bairn; he will mention that Diallos is in town—find and exhaust his dialogue. (You may need to reload the area multiple times as their positions change.)

Finally, if you have interacted with Primeval Sorcerer Azul, you can finish **Sorceress Sellen's** questline.  
- This involves backtracking: speak to her, then visit the Sellia Hideaway to meet Master Lusat, return to Sellen, and exhaust her dialogue again.  
- Next, head to Witchbane Ruins and follow Sellen’s instructions, then visit Seluvis’ secret underground puppet room to use the provided item.  
- Finally, go back to Chamber Outside the Plaza Site of Grace and head north to meet Witch-Hunter Jerren; then return to Witchbane Ruins, and finally to the Raya Lucaria Grand Library.  
  - Outside the main gate, you’ll be given a choice to help either Sellen or Jerren.  
    - Helping Sellen fixes her as a merchant at Raya Lucaria Academy.  
    - Helping Jerren yields a reward after exhausting his dialogue.
