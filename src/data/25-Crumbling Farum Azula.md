## Guide

**Elden Ring Map: Crumbling Farum Azula Starting Point.**  
Before entering Crumbling Farum Azula, head to the **Foot of the Forge Site of Grace** to fight the Fire Giant.  
- You can summon Iron Fist Alexander for aid and extra dialogue.  
- Upon defeat, the Fire Giant drops the Remembrance of the Fire Giant.

Next, head east up the mountain and along the chain to reach the **Forge of the Giants Site of Grace**.  
- Interact with Melina here to teleport to Crumbling Farum Azula.  
- (If you interacted with the Three Fingers in the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds, select the "Listen to the sound of flames" option at the Site of Grace.)

This legacy dungeon is extensive and can be confusing—refer to the Crumbling Farum Azula Walkthrough for additional details.

Once in Crumbling Farum Azula:  
- Cross the bridge; at its end, you’ll find a Smithing Stone (8).  
- Turn right and follow the path downward to a platform overlooking Azula Beastmen and an ahead building.  
- Enter the building and, in the first doorway to your left, interact with the **Crumbling Beast Grave Site of Grace**.

Exit the room and, at the end of the hallway, you return outside where a makeshift bridge lies ahead.  
- About halfway across, a Farum Azula Dragon swoops down to attack. It attacks slowly, so you can run past it to reach the **Crumbling Beast Grave Depths Site of Grace**.  
  - On your way, loot a Smithing Stone (6) and another Smithing Stone (8).

In the next room:  
- Two Azula Beastmen and a Smithing Stone (7) can be found on one of the altars.  
- You may continue through the northwestern hallway to a larger room or detour through southwest windows.  
  - Stepping out the windows, look right to find a rooftop you can climb; this gives access to a higher floor where you can collect a Smithing Stone (6) and a Great Grave Glovewort after defeating additional Azula Beastmen.  
- Jumping down through openings returns you to the larger room (or you may retrace your steps via the northwestern hallway).  
- After defeating the Azula Beastmen, loot the Ancient Dragon Prayerbook on the floor.  
- Immediately outside to the northeast is the **Tempest-Facing Balcony Site of Grace** and the Somberstone Miner's Bell Bearing (4).

For extra loot, re-enter the building and exit through the southwestern door.  
- To the right of the downward stairs is a hidden corpse with a Hero's Rune (2).  
- At the base of these stairs, a lift takes you down to an area infested with Lesser Wormface.  
  - The path here circles back to the lift; in the lake area, you can find the Glovewort Picker's Bell Bearing (3) and a Smithing Stone (8).  
  - On your return, another Smithing Stone (8) is found on arch ruins (accessible via a ladder) and a Somber Smithing Stone (9) is nearby.
- Once done, return to the **Temple-Facing Balcony Site of Grace**.

Head down the floating rocks and ruins to the west, where you encounter a large floating ruin chunk occupied by Skeletons resembling Azula Beastmen.  
- Grab the Somber Smithing Stone (7) here, then jump down north to the next ruin chunk.  
- Jump into the hole in the corner and head northeast.  
  - Through the second door on your left, an item is guarded by a Skeleton; however, proceed through the first doorway instead.  
  - Follow the path and climb a ladder to collect a Great Ghost Glovewort on the altar.  
  - Three skeletal beastmen will spawn behind you; then, exit the room and look to the left to find a safe path back to the ruin chunk.
- Continue north, picking up a Somber Smithing Stone (9) along the way, until you reach the **Dragon Temple Site of Grace**.

From here, if you turn back, you will see a set of stairs you can jump down to.  
- At the base, turn around and enter the building to grab the Azula Beastman Ashes.  
- Then, teleport back to the **Dragon Temple Site of Grace**.

Now, enter the **Dragon Temple**:  
- Beware of the wandering knights.  
- Enter through the doorway, then turn right; at the end, a Smithing Stone (6) awaits.  
- Turn left and descend the stairs, then turn right again in the hallway.  
- Before descending further, turn left into another hallway to find a Stonesword Key.  
  - Continuing down this path reveals two Dragonwound Grease and a Golden Rune (12).  
  - If these do not interest you, backtrack to the stairs and continue down to the main hall.
- In the large hall, fight the **Godskin Duo**; upon defeat, you receive the Smithing-Stone Miner's Bell Bearing (4) and the Ash of War: Black Flame Tornado.  
- The **Dragon Temple Altar Site of Grace** spawns here—continue further into Crumbling Farum Azula.

Exiting out the southeastern door reveals the **Dragon Temple Transept Site of Grace**.  
- The path forward is out the northeastern door instead; jump down to a lower platform populated by Azula Beastmen, then turn left and descend the stairs.  
- Upon emerging outside, check ruin windows on your left; if you have ranged abilities, it is advisable to snipe Rotten Strays and Azula Beastmen from afar.  
- Head through the window and search behind ruin walls for a Hero's Rune (5).  
- Jump down the ruins to the north and continue forward; note the doorway on the right at the end of the hallway.  
- Outside, check behind a pillar for a Smithing Stone (7), then ascend the stairs on your right.

At the top of the stairs, turn left to find a column floating diagonally—jump on and climb it.  
- Here, you will find an Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone guarded by a Rotten Stray.  
- Backtrack to the top of the stairs and head west, where a Somber Smithing Stone (9) and an imp statue are present.  
  - The imp statue locks off a large optional area; if unlocked, you can take the lift behind it to the **Dragon Temple Lift Site of Grace**.  
  - This area is rich in loot.
- Turn left after exiting the doorway to enter a courtyard full of Skeletons.  
  - In the central fountain is a Lord's Rune.
- Continue forward on the right side of the courtyard until you reach an elevated platform with more Skeletons.  
  - On the east side of the platform, a corpse holds a Smithing Stone (8).  
  - Head west to find a Rune Arc and a Golden Seed close together.
- Continue southwest, down the slope, and find a Teardrop Scarab that drops the Golden Lightning Fortification Incantation and a Smithing Stone (8).

Climb back up the slope and turn left to traverse a series of ruins.  
- At the end of the path, you will reencounter the Farum Azula Dragon (which previously attacked).  
- Continue until you reach a ruined structure containing the Ancient Dragon Apostle's Cookbook (4); be cautious of two Skeletons that will attack upon picking up the item.

In the same area, speak with Iron Fist Alexander—accept his proposal to finish his quest.  
- He will give you the Shard of Alexander and Alexander's Innards.

When finished, teleport back to the **Dragon Temple Lift Site of Grace**.  
- Take the lift down, then backtrack to the earlier noted doorway.  
- Continue forward, jumping down ruins to pick up the **Dragoncrest Shield Talisman (+2)** hidden within.  
- Follow the path to an open area where you will encounter a Crucible Knight (defeating which means it will not respawn).

Head southwest next. There are two options to reach the next Site of Grace:  
- Option 1: Jump over the banister of a balcony.  
- Option 2: Make a tricky jump onto floating ruins to pick up an item.  
- Once you interact with the **Dragon Temple Rooftop Site of Grace**, jump down from the roofs and collect a Smithing Stone (6) next to some Eagles.  
- Descend the ladder in front of you; if you look to the left, you will see a floating platform you can jump to.  
- Follow the path to obtain the Drake Knight Set, which allows you to circle back to the Rooftop Site of Grace.

Head back down the ladder and proceed south towards the Farum Azula Dragon.  
- Fight more Eagles and avoid lightning (red areas indicate impending strikes).  
- When you reach the Dragon (which will be at low health), defeat it quickly before it flees to obtain an Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone.  
  - A Somber Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone can be found in the gazebo behind the dragon.
- To the left of the gazebo, you will see platforms—follow them to find the Boltdrake Talisman (+2) and Dragon Towershield, then circle back to the rooftops.
- Return to the dragon’s location and head southwest.

Go up the slope and then turn right, crossing ruins to the north.  
- You will find a temple to your right with the Somberstone Miner's Bell Bearing (5) in front of its altar.  
- Be cautious, as two strong Azula Beastmen will ambush you here.
- In the temple’s south side, a path and elevator take you to the **Beside the Great Bridge Site of Grace**.

From here, you have multiple options:  
- To fight **Dragonlord Placidusax**, head back down the elevator and exit the temple.  
  - Proceed straight to the cliff edge; if you look down, floating platforms can be jumped onto.  
  - Follow the path to a large empty platform; a prompt to lie down will appear.  
  - After a cutscene, you will enter the boss arena.  
  - Defeat Dragonlord Placidusax to receive the Remembrance of the Dragonlord; interact with the Site of Grace spawned here.
- Teleport back to the **Beside the Great Bridge Site of Grace** and follow the stairs up to a large crumbling bridge.  
  - For additional loot, head north down the bridge, then enter a building.  
  - Upon exiting, turn left to find a Somber Smithing Stone (8).  
  - On the right, there is a ladder—if you have completed Bernahl's questline and defeated Rykard, Recusant Bernahl may invade halfway across; defeat him for the Blasphemous Claw, the Devourer's Scepter, and the Beast Champion Set.  
  - In a building ahead, you will find a chest with the Old Lord's Talisman guarded by several Azula Beastmen.
- After that area, teleport back to the **Beside the Great Bridge Site of Grace** and return to the bridge.  
  - Head up the bridge this time until you encounter a Draconic Tree Sentinel; defeating it nets you the Malformed Dragon Set.  
  - Continue up the bridge, collect the Somber Smithing Stone (7), then head through the fog door.

> **IMPORTANT:** Defeating the next boss causes irreversible changes to the world until NG+—ensure all NPC quests and achievement items in Leyndell, Royal Capital are complete before proceeding.

Proceed to fight the **Beast Clergyman**.  
- If you gave Gurranq all nine Deathroot, his dialogue changes during the fight.  
- When his health reaches 50%, a cutscene triggers and he transforms into **Maliketh, the Black Blade**.  
- Upon defeating him, you receive the Remembrance of the Black Blade and are teleported back to Leyndell (now in a different state).  
- If you return to Maliketh's boss area, you can interact with the **Maliketh, the Black Blade Site of Grace**.
