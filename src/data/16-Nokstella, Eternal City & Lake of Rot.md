## Guide

**Elden Ring Map: Nokstella Eternal City Starting Point.**  
Begin in northwest Liurnia of the Lakes.  
- Take the stairs to the top of Renna’s Rise and use the waygate there to teleport to Ainsel River Main (a northern part of Ainsel River that was previously inaccessible).  
- Inside an open coffin, you will find Miniature Ranni; keep this doll for later use. (If you haven’t progressed in Ranni’s quest, the Renna’s Rise waygate will be inaccessible; alternatively, use the coffin at the edge of the waterfall in northwestern Deeproot Depths.)

Next:  
- Interact with the Ainsel River Main Site of Grace and follow the path through the river into another section of the Uhl Palace Ruins.  
- Clear enemies and collect loot (including Ghost Gloveworts [6] & [7], Smithing Stone [4], and a Stonesword Key).

Continue west along the path (be careful not to fall back to lower floors) until you reach **Nokstella, Eternal City**.  
- Explore the city to collect equipment and upgrade materials; note items such as Archer Ashes, Nightmaiden & Swordstress Puppets, and Ghost-Glovewort Picker’s Bell Bearing [2] can be found in buildings near the entrance.  
- Also search for the Moon of Nokstella—a talisman that increases your memory slots (located in the northwest of the city).  
- While exploring, you may also find two Larval Tears and a Golden Seed (these are limited per playthrough).

After exploration:  
- Head to the far western side of Nokstella to locate a lift that takes you back down to Ainsel River Main.  
- At the lift’s Site of Grace, you will be given the option to speak with Miniature Ranni. (She will ignore you the first two times, but eventually ask you to defeat a Baleful Shadow.)  
- To find this enemy, head south then follow the river west, looking for a small opening south of the Nokstella Waterfall Basin Site of Grace. Defeat the Baleful Shadow to receive the Discarded Palace Key.

Next:  
- Find a building housing a lift that will take you down to **Lake Rot**.  
- At the water's edge (just past a Site of Grace), loot a corpse for the Lake of Rot map fragment to ease navigation.

Now, a quick detour for Ranni’s quest:  
- Teleport back to the Raya Lucaria Grand Library.  
- In a small chest next to a bookshelf (northwest of Rennala), unlock it with the Discarded Palace Key obtained earlier to get Ranni’s ring, the Dark Moon Ring.  
- Then, teleport back to Lake Rot.

**Lake of Rot Specifics:**  
- The water rapidly applies the Scarlet Rot status effect. Equip plenty of Preserving Boluses or use the incantation *Flame Cleanse Me* (requires 12 faith).  
  - If you lack the faith, equip the Two Fingers Heirloom (+5 faith) or use a Rune Arc with Godrick’s Great Rune for a total bonus of +10 faith.  
  - *Flame Cleanse Me* can also be found on a corpse at the Fire Monk camp (southeast of the Church of Vows); it requires a Sacred Seal to cast, which can be purchased from the Roundtable Hold mummies.  
- It is recommended to adjust your flask allocation to include one or two mana flasks.

Additionally, as you look out over the lake, you may see four pillars on small islands in the distance. These islands have buttons that raise land masses, creating safe platforms for navigating the lake.  
- The nearest pillar (starting island) is to the southwest; the next is south of the first.  
- You might notice a familiar boss in the middle of the lake—ignore him for now and focus on raising all the land masses to simplify collection and boss fights.

With the land masses raised:  
- Face the boss in the middle of the lake (next to three raised islands): the Dragonkin Soldier. Defeat him while avoiding being knocked into the water.  
- Afterwards, loot scattered bodies for items such as Somber Smithing Stones [7] & [8].  
- Notably, a lone chest in a large ruin (southwest section) yields the Nomadic Warrior's Cookbook [22].  
- Also, an enemy on one of the raised platforms drops the greatsword *Alabaster Lord's Sword*.

After this:  
- Head over to the southern section of the lake to find a waterfall.  
- Climb down the stairs beside the waterfall to reach the **Grand Cloister**.  
- (If you’re not exploring further, head west then south past a group of enemies to find an open coffin at the tip of the waterfall; interacting with it triggers a cutscene.)

If you open your map now, you’ll find yourself in an isolated area south of the lake.  
- Through a mist door, you will fight Astel, Naturalborn of the Void. Defeating Astel means all underground areas have been explored.  
- Then, head north past Astel’s boss room to find a lift that returns you to the surface at **Deep Ainsel Well**.

Regardless of whether you fought Glintstone Dragon Adula near Ranni’s Rise earlier, he will reappear at the entrance of **Moonlight Altar**.  
- Discover the grace inside, then head northeast to the **Cathedral of Manus Celes** (follow its dedicated walkthrough).

After the Cathedral events:  
- Return to Ranni’s Rise and speak with Miniature Ranni at the Site of Grace.  
- When exiting the tower, you will encounter Blaidd mumbling; defend yourself to receive the Royal Greatsword and Blaidd's Set (minus the helm).  
- Visit Iji and exhaust his dialogue. Upon reloading, you can pick up Iji's Mirrorhelm and Iji's Bell Bearing.

> **IMPORTANT:** From this point onward, you should be strong enough to take on Dragonbarrow in Caelid. (See the Dragonbarrow page for loot details.)
