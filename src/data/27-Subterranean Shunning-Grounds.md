## Guide

**Elden Ring Map: Subterranean Shunning-Grounds Starting Point.**  
This area lies underneath Leyndell. Its maze-like sewers are best tackled later due to tough enemies, although it remains untouched if you delay.

### How to Access  
- In Leyndell, Royal Capital, you can access the Shunning-Grounds by leaving the **Avenue Balcony Site of Grace** and jumping down into the well beneath the large dragon wing.  
  - At the bottom, find a Rune Arc and several gates; open the door at the end to reach a platform overlooking the main hallway.
- In endgame Leyndell, from the first Site of Grace, head southwest until you find a road with a hole.  
  - Jump down to access a wooden beam with a corpse holding the Crimson Amber Medallion +2.  
  - Jump to the bottom to arrive at the main hallway.

This area is called the main hallway because many shortcuts converge here. Be cautious of patrolling Ogres.

### Navigation

1. **Underground Roadside Site of Grace:**  
   - From the main hallway, head northeast and enter the first door on your left to find the Underground Roadside Site of Grace.  
   - Exit the room and continue northeast to pick up the Bloodsoaked Mask and Bloodsoaked Manchettes from a corpse.  
   - Then, head back southwest and find a ladder in a cubby in the wall.

2. **Pipe Room:**  
   - Navigate a series of pipes; Imps will ambush from higher ledges—use ranged attacks to clear them.  
   - Follow the pipes southwest, then turn left at a corner to reach a large wooden platform with crates and barrels.  
   - The pipes split:  
     - Right branch descends to a Somber Smithing Stone (6).  
     - Left branch leads to a small wooden platform and then to an upper ledge with a Smithing Stone (7) and a doorway.

3. **Staircase and Shadow Bait Incantation:**  
   - Go through the doorway, turn right, and ascend the stairs.  
   - In the room, pick up the Shadow Bait Incantation. Note that an Ogre in the corner will attack upon pickup.  
   - To the northeast, a gate can be opened with a lever, providing a shortcut back to the main hallway.

4. **Return and Lower Pipe:**  
   - Head south and descend a ladder from a cubby in the left wall to return to the pipe room.  
   - Instead of ascending further, jump down to the lower pipe (be cautious of fall damage).  
   - Optionally, kill the Giant Lobster in this section, then jump down onto the floor.

5. **Additional Encounters:**  
   - Turn left to find another Giant Lobster.  
   - A Teardrop Scarab here drops a Somber Smithing Stone (7).  
   - A corpse on the far wall has Mohg's Shackle.  
   - Then, exit through a hole in the southwestern wall and turn right to reach the **Leyndell Catacombs Site of Grace**.
   - Ascend the stairs and turn right to find a lift.  
     - In the lift room, hit the illusory walls on the right to reveal a Spirit-Caller Snail and the Haligdrake Talisman (+1), or simply run past.
   - At the end of the hallway, pull a lever that opens a shortcut back to the main hallway.

6. **Shortcut and Flooded Room:**  
   - Head back down to the Leyndell Catacombs Site of Grace.  
   - Descend the stairs and turn left; at the end, enter a flooded room.  
   - Climb the stairs inside to find a corpse with a Ghost Glovewort (6).  
   - Exit into the southwestern hallway; instead of turning right, hop onto a circular platform to reach a higher floor.

7. **Ogre and Crucible Scale Talisman:**  
   - In the elevated room, an Ogre guards the Crucible Scale Talisman on an altar.  
   - Grab it and then head back down the platform, turning left into a familiar hallway.  
   - At the top of two staircases, an Ogre and a Grave Glovewort (9) await.  
   - Enter the next room, jump down the middle to collect Grave Glovewort (8).  
   - Optionally, to acquire Ghost Glovewort (8) and Golden Rune (11), proceed to the northwest hallway, turn left, and enter the adjacent room (beware of two Ogres).  
   - Then, backtrack to the previous room and ascend the southeast stairs.

8. **Additional Passage:**  
   - Turn right into a hallway with a layout similar to an earlier area.  
   - Ascend a circular platform and take a right into another hallway with a couple of Imps.  
   - Follow the stairs, then a ladder, and pull a lever in front of a statue to open a new area.

9. **Final Shortcut and Boss Fight:**  
   - Jump down to the lower level and then head northwest; turn right to return to the Leyndell Catacombs Site of Grace, then turn left to descend to a fog door.  
   - Beyond the fog door, fight **Esgar, Priest of Blood**. Defeating him grants the Lord of Blood's Exultation.

10. **Dung Eater:**  
    - Teleport back to the Underground Roadside Site of Grace.  
    - Head northeast; on the left, locate an open sewer grate and jump down to the northwest.  
    - Ignore a nearby wall opening; continue to the end and turn left.  
    - Pass two Giant Poison Flowers and climb a ladder at the tunnel's end.  
    - Be cautious as Spider Hands fall from the ceiling. Turn right to enter the room where a jail cell houses **Dung Eater**.  
    - Speak to him to free him and continue his quest.
    - Later, return to the Roundtable Hold where he will leave a message; defeat him during his invasion in the Capital Outskirts to receive the Sword of Milos.
  
11. **Additional Sewer Navigation:**  
    - After the jail area, return to the opening in the wall. The tunnels are maze-like and populated by Slugs.  
    - Follow the natural left turn, jump over gaps, and collect a corpse with a Glass Shard.  
    - Continue, turning right at a corner, then through an open gate, following the path that slopes slightly down.
    - At the end, if the room opens to a Somber Smithing Stone (8) guarded by an Ogre, ascend a ladder, then open another shortcut back to the main hallway.
    - In that room, you will encounter two Ogres; use a narrow doorway on the southern wall to bypass them and pick up a Smithing Stone (7) in front of a statue.
    - Then, turn left, reach the top of the broken stairway, and find a Teardrop Scarab dropping Somber Smithing Stone (6).  
    - Follow the stairs down and pick up the Silver-Pickled Fowl Foot from a corpse before entering the adjacent doorway.
  
12. **Basilisk Tunnel:**  
    - Turn left at the corner, then again at the tunnel’s end.  
    - Descend the stairs (not the ladder); at the bottom, turn completely around to enter a small room beneath a previous platform.  
    - Navigate narrow tunnels infested with Basilisks; turn left at a corpse with Preserving Boluses, then right where the tunnel slopes upward.  
    - Defeat the Basilisks in adjacent cubbies, then proceed until the tunnel slopes upward into a large room with another Ogre.
    - Loot all corpses for four Glass Shards, a Dappled White Cured Meat, and two Golden Centipedes.  
    - Ascend a ladder and exit through the door to the northwest to open the final shortcut back to the main hallway (directly opposite the Underground Roadside Site of Grace).
  
13. **Final Pipe Shortcut:**  
    - Return to the wooden bridge, then hop onto a pipe heading southwest.  
    - Follow the pipe up and to the left (watch for Imps).  
    - At the top, jump down onto wooden scaffolding below; enter the doorway (do not descend the ladder) to return to the room with the Ogre and the corpses holding Glass Shards and Golden Centipedes.
    - Jump onto the pipe and enter its opening.
  
14. **Giant Rats and Final Descent:**  
    - Navigate through another set of narrow tunnels (encounter Giant Rats along the way).  
    - The tunnel naturally turns right then left; at a split, turn right through an open gate.  
    - Continue until the tunnel slopes down and opens into a room with a Somber Smithing Stone (8) and an Ogre guarding a ladder.
    - Ascend the ladder, then immediately turn southwest to open another shortcut to the main hallway.
    - At the far east side of this room, two Ogres sit in front of a statue. Open the door on the southern wall to force the Ogres to remain behind, pick up the Smithing Stone (7) in front of the statue, then run through the door.
  
15. **Final Staircase and Lift:**  
    - Turn left to reach the top of a broken stairway; find a Teardrop Scarab dropping Somber Smithing Stone (6).  
    - Follow the stairs down, pick up the Silver-Pickled Fowl Foot, and then turn left at the tunnel’s end.  
    - Continue down the stairs (not the ladder) until you find a small room beneath the previous platform.
  
16. **Ritual Pot and Forsaken Depths:**  
    - In the next room, locate a Ritual Pot on a corpse among a group of Living Jars.  
    - Head northeast and take the cage lift down to the **Forsaken Depths Site of Grace**.  
    - Follow the path to the fog door leading to **Mohg, the Omen**.  
    - Use Mohg's Shackle (found earlier) to stun him twice during the fight.  
    - Defeat him to obtain the Bloodflame Talons Incantation and interact with the **Cathedral of the Forsaken Site of Grace**.  
    - In a chest at the altar, loot the Erdtree's Favor (+1).

17. **Optional Hyetta’s Questline:**  
    - If pursuing Hyetta's quest or to unlock an ending, attack the altar to reveal a secret passage leading to a large shaft.  
    - Jump down safely to two wooden beams.  
    - Then, deliberately fall to break the floor (you will die, but re-fall to survive on a lower platform).  
    - At the bottom, pick up Frenzied's Cookbook (2) to complete Hyetta’s quest.  
    - At the far end of the corridor, a pair of double doors appears—interact with them while all equipment is unequipped to trigger a cutscene and access one of the endings.  
    - After, speak with Hyetta to retrieve an item. (Note: After this, Melina will leave you at the next Site of Grace and you will be locked to this ending until you acquire Miquella's Needle.)

When all is complete, you have finished the **Subterranean Shunning-Grounds**.
