**Level:** 70+  
**Upgrades:** +15 ~ +20

## Objectives

- Get Reward from Ranni  
- Access Carian Study Hall Hidden Area  
- Obtain the Cursemark of Death  
- Help Iron Fist Alexander

## Guide

Before finishing up the underground areas, return to Ranni's Rise to hand over the Fingerslayer Blade that Ranni requested.  
> **Note:** If you plan to do Seluvis' questline or wish to give his potion to Dung Eater, delay delivering the Fingerslayer Blade until that is completed. A choice must be made at the end of Seluvis’ questline; betrayal will antagonize a character, though absolution can later be found at the Church of Vows.

Once delivered:  
- Give the treasure of Nokron (the blade) to Ranni. In return, she will reward you with the Carian Inverted Statue. Its description instructs you to head to the **Carian Study Hall** (a big tower in Central Eastern Liurnia near Jarburg).  
- Near the Study Hall’s entrance, recall the tall globe. Interact with the pedestal there to place the statue; a cutscene will play.

> **Note:** If you have not yet visited the Carian Study Hall, consider exploring it first for additional loot and opportunities to snipe fingercreepers on ledges later.

Next steps:  
- Head to the elevator shaft and enter the secret area through the small window.  
- Shortly after entering, Preceptor Miriam will attack. Use ranged attacks or close the distance by turning right and moving down the wall side.  
- After defeating her and collecting her loot, locate a Mask of Confidence on a corpse on the left (opposite your entry point).  
- Continue by jumping down platforms and beams until you reach a button on a central platform.

This platform takes you down to a bridge with the **Liurnia Tower Bridge Site of Grace** at its beginning, guarded by a large enemy. Whether you defeat it or bypass it, crossing the bridge will take you to the **Divine Tower of Liurnia**.  
- Climb ladders and stairs to the top; there you will find a body containing a Stargazer Heirloom and a Cursemark of Death (a key item for Fia's quest).

Completing this step unlocks additional collectible items:  
- Ranni disappears from her tower.  
- Speaking to Iji provides insights on her whereabouts.  
- In Seluvis’s Rise, you now have access to Seluvis' armor set (the Preceptor's Set) and related items.  
- In addition, Ranni’s armor set (the Snow Witch Set) can be found in a chest up the ladder in Renna’s Rise.  
- Return to Pidia in Caria Manor for a scene and to pick up Pidia's Bell Bearing & Dolores the Sleeping Arrow Puppet.

While in Liurnia, also explore the area in the East (near where you encountered the Tibia Mariner, just south of the Carian Study Hall) to meet Iron Fist Alexander. Use an Oil Pot to free him.  
> **Note:** If you encountered Alexander in Mt. Gelmir (near the Magma Wyrm) prior to seeing him near Jarburg, this portion of his quest may be skipped but will still proceed as normal.

From here, proceed to **Deeproot Depths** to advance Fia's quest.
