## Guide

**Elden Ring Map: Miquella's Haligtree Starting Point.**  
This section covers Miquella's Haligtree. (It is possible—and slightly easier—to complete Crumbling Farum Azula at this point, but doing so causes several world changes that can affect later progression.)

Miquella's Haligtree is split into two main parts:  
1. The **tree canopy area**  
2. The walled structure within the Haligtree, **Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree**

After being transported to the canopy from Ordina, Liturgical Town, the way forward is mostly northeastward.  
- Numerous branching paths exist, offering loot such as two Stonesword Keys, the Prattling Pate "My Beloved", the Envoy Crown, a Lost Ash of War, and the Oracle Envoy Ashes.  
- Beware of Oracle Envoys as they deal heavy, long-range, homing damage.

Once you pass a giant Oracle Envoy, descend a ladder on the left side of a wide tree branch to reach the **Haligtree Town Site of Grace**.  
- From here, the path forward becomes more obvious with fewer deadly enemies.  
- Start by descending the stairs; before the final flight, climb a ladder on the left to find the **Pearldrake Talisman (+2)**.  
- Continue forward, passing an axe-wielding Misbegotten (guarding a Smithing Stone (8)), two Giant Poison Flowers, and a large Misbegotten protecting an Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone, until you reach the **Haligtree Town Plaza Site of Grace**.

From the Plaza, head south to reach roofs occupied by Lesser Spirit-Caller Snails.  
- Looking down to your right, jump from a building roof to reveal a chest containing the **Viridian Amber Medallion +2**.  
- Continue south, jumping down to the next platform.  
- Climb a ladder to a hoard of mushroom-infested zombies, then proceed by descending the eastern ladder and reentering the building on the east side.

Next, you will encounter a series of bridges connecting to a single gazebo guarded by Battlemages.  
- Defeat them to pick up Smithing Stones (7) & (8) from the corpses.  
- Cross one bridge to activate a shortcut back to the **Haligtree Town Site of Grace**.  
- Then cross another bridge to a large promenade where **Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree** spawns.  
  - Defeat her to acquire Loretta’s Mastery and her weapon, *Loretta’s War Sickle*.  
- Interact with the **Haligtree Promenade Site of Grace** and continue north down a flight of stairs.  
- Before the elevator room, climb a ladder to obtain an Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone.  
- Then backtrack to the elevator, which takes you down to **Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree**.

### Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree

Elphael is the second part of the legacy dungeon, featuring different enemies and scenery.  
- Cross the bridge guarded by a Cleanrot Knight to reach the **Prayer Room Site of Grace**.  
- Millicent is found here; speak with her and exhaust her dialogue, then continue forward.

There are multiple paths in Elphael.  
- Notable items include the Marika’s Soreseal and Triple Rings of Light Incantation (each behind its own imp statue), the Miquella Knight's Sword (located below the bell in the central bell tower), and various ashes (Haligtree Soldier Ashes, Cleanrot Knight Finlay Ashes, and two Seedbed Curses) deeper into the castle walls.

Eventually, you will reach a courtyard with an Erdtree Avatar overlooked by ballistae.  
- Defeat the Erdtree Avatar, then interact with the **Elphael Inner Wall Site of Grace** behind it.  
- Proceed through the doorway down the steps; on your left, you will see a chest (behind tree roots) containing the Rotten Crystal Sword.  
- Turn right to continue and climb the tree root to pass through an opening in the wall.

This opens to a cliffside with a waterfall.  
- The water here inflicts scarlet rot (similar to the Lake of Rot).  
- Expect to encounter several Lesser Kindreds of Rot along the path.  
- The route is linear; continue to the opposite cliff to either climb further or enter a doorway to the right.  
  - It may be advisable to take the doorway first as the subsequent path leads to the **Drainage Channel Site of Grace**, which is challenging.

If you continue upward and cross the tree roots, you’ll reach a secluded lake.  
- In its center, a Great Ghost Glovewort awaits—but be warned, a Lesser Ulcerated Tree Spirit will ambush you from the water. Defeat it to obtain a Golden Seed.  
- For those following Millicent's quest, you can finish her questline here by either assisting her via a summon sign (for her invaders) or by invading her; the rewards differ (Rotten Winged Sword Insignia and Unalloyed Gold Needle vs. Millicent’s Prosthesis).  
- If you interact with the Three Fingers and wish to remove the Frenzied Flame, make sure to assist her.  
- You may also return to Gowry in Gowry's Shack for additional dialogue (which varies based on your choice with Millicent).

Back at the **Drainage Channel Site of Grace**:  
- Follow the tree roots and support beams to a roof with a gap.  
- Jump down into the building; to the west is a balcony where you can find the **Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman**.  
- Jump down to the lowest floor; if you wish to explore the courtyard for additional Ghost Gloveworts and the Ghost-Glovewort Picker's Bell Bearing (3), exit through the eastern door. Otherwise, take the southwestern door to access a lift.

Immediately to your left (southeast) is a room with a large scarlet flower and **Melina's Set**.  
- Climb its stairs to activate a shortcut at the bell tower, then return to interact with the **Haligtree Roots Site of Grace**.  
- Finally, enter the fog door in front of you to challenge **Malenia, Blade of Miquella**.  
  - (This is a difficult boss; consult her page for tips.)  
- Defeat her to receive the Remembrance of the Rot Goddess and Malenia’s Great Rune.  
- Interact with the **Malenia, Goddess of Rot Site of Grace** that appears after her defeat.  
- With this, Elphael, Brace of the Haligtree (and by extension Miquella's Haligtree) is complete.

> **Optional:** To remove the Frenzied Flame, reload Malenia’s boss arena and return the Unalloyed Gold Needle to the Scarlet Aeonia to receive Miquella's Needle.

If you have already met him, you can finish Dung Eater's questline by returning to him in the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds and giving him five Seedbed Curses. This rewards you with the Mending Rune of the Fell Curse (unlocking another alternate ending).
