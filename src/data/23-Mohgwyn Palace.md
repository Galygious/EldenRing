## Guide

**Elden Ring Map: Mohgwyn Palace Starting Point.**  
If you have followed Varre’s quest, you may already have the Pureblood Knight’s Medal, which allows teleportation to Mohgwyn Palace. (It is not recommended to use it too early, as the area is very challenging.)  
- Once you reach Consecrated Snowfield, take the waygate to teleport into a set of caves southeast of Mohgwyn Palace.  
- These caves are linear; follow the path out and down to reach the **Palace Approach Ledge-Road Site of Grace**.  
- Make your way northwest, where the slope is littered with Albinaurics. Grab the Smithing Stone (6) along the way.  
- At the bottom, you will emerge into the main blood lake of Mohgwyn Palace.

If desired, continue north-northwest until you reach a section with three hunting horn-wielding Albinaurics (who can summon spectral skeletons).  
- Defeat them (or run past them) and then head west to find a ruin with a lone corpse containing the Mohgwyn Palace map fragment.  
- (If you used the Pureblood Knight's Medal, you will spawn at the ruin’s entrance.)  
- Head up the stairs quickly to grab the **Dynasty Mausoleum Entrance Site of Grace**.

Now that you have the map, navigation becomes easier.  
- The eastern side of Mohgwyn Palace is dominated by a blood-red lake.  
- As you explore the lake area, you will be invaded by three Nameless White Masks (each in different parts). Defeating them grants the War Surgeon Set.  
- In the lake’s southern section, you can find the Haligdrake Talisman (+2), a Golden Seed, and the Nomadic Warrior's Cookbook (24).  
- In the northern section (and in the caves lining the eastern wall), loot the Ash of War: Blood Tax, the Swarm of Flies Incantation, and various upgrade materials.

Make your way back to the **Dynasty Mausoleum Site of Grace** and head up the southwest stairs.  
- In this area, you will encounter several Putrid Corpses.  
- Either defeat them or bypass them; along the way, pick up a Smithing Stone (7), Numen's Rune, and a Stonesword Key.

Eventually, you will come to a group of Putrid Corpses gathered before a dark doorway.  
- This doorway leads into a very dark cave—ensure you have a lantern or torch ready.  
- As you explore the cave, Sanguine Nobles will ambush you; if you die, respawn at the Stake of Marika outside the cave.  
- (If you have progressed Varre’s quests, an invasion sign for his world appears near the doorway. You may choose to invade him; he will later appear again.)  
- At the first cave split, a Sanguine Noble appears; take the southern split before heading north to find the Imprisoned Merchant.

As you proceed north, you will immediately see a Lord's Rune.  
- Continue northeast to a ledge overlooking a large cluster of Putrid Corpses.  
- Use your torch to reveal a hoard of Putrid Corpses from which you can collect a Great Ghost Glovewort.  
- Then, head west where you encounter another Sanguine Noble and a Smithing Stone (8) among some gravestones.  
- Follow the path and pick up Ghost Glovewort (9) until you eventually emerge at the **Dynasty Mausoleum Midpoint Site of Grace**.  
  - (If you invaded Varre, he will be in the corridor before this site—exhaust his dialogue to receive six Festering Bloody Fingers and Varre’s Bouquet.)

Ahead, a group of Albinaurics and a Sanguine Noble face a large statue.  
- Defeat them; in front of the statue, you’ll find a Somber Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone and, if you peek on the lower ledge behind it, a Stonesword Key.

Turn around and, facing northwest, take the lift up to a large ruined temple.  
- Upon entering, a cutscene plays and you must fight **Mohg, Lord of Blood**.  
- Defeat him to obtain the Remembrance of the Blood Lord and Mohg's Great Rune.  
- The **Cocoon of the Empyrean Site of Grace** spawns here after his defeat.
