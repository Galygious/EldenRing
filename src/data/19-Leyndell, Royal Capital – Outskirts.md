## Guide

**Elden Ring Map: Leyndell, Royal Capital Starting Point.**  
There are two ways to access Leyndell, Royal Capital. We approach it from south to north to procure the map fragment early.  
- Begin at the **Altus Highway Junction Site of Grace**, then take the large bridge up to the gates.  
- Here, you will encounter a duo of Tree Sentinel bosses that drop the Erdtree Greatshield (optional to fight).  
- Alternatively, bypass them and reach the **Outer Wall Phantom Tree Site of Grace**, where you can collect 2× Golden Seed and the Leyndell, Royal Capital map fragment.

From this site:  
- Head south to a small military camp to fight a Lesser Ulcerated Tree Spirit (drops a Golden Seed).  
- Further east, reach the **Minor Erdtree Church** and loot Missionary's Cookbook (4) and the Golden Order Seal.  
- Then, travel north, slightly east, and descend into a watery area.  
  - At its southern tip lies the **Sealed Tunnel** (hit the illusory wall to enter).  
    - This tunnel has secret areas—see the Secret Tunnel guide for details.  
    - Notable loot includes the Smithing-Stone Miner's Bell Bearing (2), Smithing Stones (5) & (6), and Somber Smithing Stone (6).  
    - The boss Onyx Lord drops the Onyx Lord's Greatsword.  
    - The tunnel also serves as a passage to the Divine Tower of West Altus (activate Rykard's Rune later).

Return to the **Outer Wall Phantom Tree Site of Grace** and take the road north.  
- Optionally, fight a Gargoyle or bypass until you find another Golden Seed and the Palm Reader.  
  - A nearby teardrop scarab drops Ash of War: Golden Parry.  
- Take the road northwest and listen for the voice “I see you, tarnished.” This is Margitt—defeat him for the Viridian Amber Medallion +1.  
- Press on and activate the **Outer Wall Battleground Site of Grace**.

Next:  
- Turn eastward until a road leads further east. Optionally, take a northern detour (via a U-turn) to reach the **Hermit Merchant's Shack** (with nighttime invasions: Bell Bearing Hunter and Deathbird).  
- Then, take the road east and north; do not go to the Minor Erdtree yet as an altar at the road’s top holds the Winged Crystal Tear.  
  - After collecting it, visit the Minor Erdtree and loot Twiggy Cracked Tear and Crimson Crystal Tear.

Travel directly south until you see a moat at the wall's base.  
- If you followed Liurnia’s instructions, you will meet **Blackguard Big Boggart** here (from whom you can purchase Boiled Crab).  
- The moat may also trigger an invasion from Dung Eater; if so, reload the area repeatedly to pick up a Seedbed Curse (optional for his quest).

Follow the path east where the road splits north and south:  
- South: You can tackle **Auriza Hero's Grave** for heavy armor and weapons.  
- North: **Auriza Side Tomb** yields the Soldjars of Fortune Ashes (summons "potboys" for assistance), Grave Glovewort (5) & (6), Ghost Glovewort (6), and Perfumer's Cookbook (3).

Turn back to the Minor Erdtree and return to the main higher road.  
- Follow the higher path east until it becomes an open-field boss fight with the **Draconic Tree Sentinel**.  
  - Defeating it rewards you with the Dragon Greatclaw, Dragonclaw Shield, and access to the **Legacy Dungeon** of Leyndell, Capital City.

### Legacy Dungeon Walkthrough (Summary)

1. Enter Leyndell.  
2. Proceed to the Erdtree Sanctuary.  
3. Defeat Godfrey, First Elden Lord (Golden Shade).  
4. Enter the Queen's Bedchamber.  
5. Defeat Morgott the Omen King.  
6. (The barrier in the Capital Outskirts is removed.)  
7. Proceed to the Forbidden Lands.

At the entrance to Leyndell (by the **East Capital Rampart Site of Grace**), you’ll find Boc.  
- This is his final location until a major choice is made in his quest.  
- Hand over the Gold Sewing Needle and Golden Tailoring Tools to Boc and exhaust his dialogue (stop after the "Have you ever thought so?" dialogue).  
  - You then have two options:  
    - Give him a Larval Tear (to help his rebirth; he will next appear next to Rennala at the Academy of Raya Lucaria), or  
    - Continue his dialogue (without the tear) and then use the Prattling Pate "You're Beautiful" to keep him in place.

While in Leyndell, also grab the **Golden Order Principia** near the Erdtree Sanctuary Site of Grace.  
- Give it to Brother Corhyn to learn the Law of Regression incantation.  
- Exhaust Corhyn’s dialogue about Goldmask, then return to the Erdtree Sanctuary Site of Grace.  
- Head west, take the lift down, descend the stairs, and find a white message near a statue of Radagon.  
- Cast the Law of Regression on the message, read the new message, then return to Goldmask to report your findings and exhaust Corhyn's dialogue.

After defeating Morgott, speak with him for extra dialogue.  
- Return to the **Godrick the Grafted Site of Grace** where you’ll find Nepheli, Kenneth, and Gostoc together (complete Nepheli and Kenneth's quests first).  
- Exhaust all their dialogue; Nepheli will give you an Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone, and Gostoc will now also sell one.

Returning to the **Roundtable Hold** after entering Leyndell, you'll sometimes encounter the Dung Eater as an invader.  
- He does not attack immediately; speak with him to start his quest.  
- Continue to speak with Roderika at the Roundtable Hold whenever Dung Eater appears for new dialogue.  
- If you’ve followed this walkthrough, you’ll have picked up a Seedbed Curse.  
- Speak to Dung Eater while holding it, and he will give you the Sewer-Gaol Key.

The **Subterranean Shunning-Grounds** (discussed later) can also be accessed from Leyndell, but this area is better tackled later due to tougher enemies and is integral to parts of Dung Eater and Hyetta's quests. (Click the link for that section.)
